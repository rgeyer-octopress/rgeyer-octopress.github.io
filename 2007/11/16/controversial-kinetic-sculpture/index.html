<p>It&rsquo;s been entirely too long since I&rsquo;ve made a blog entry, and I&rsquo;ve got a lot of stuff lined up when I finally get a few free minutes.<br /><br />In the meantime, this was sent to me, and I found it very interesting, if only from a technical and art perspective.  There is a lot of controversy over the inventor/artists use of the analogy of &ldquo;life&rdquo; and &ldquo;evolution&rdquo;.  I&rsquo;m not willing to throw my hat into that circle, and I&rsquo;m looking at this as a purely academic and scientific pursuit.  You&rsquo;re welcome to feel differently.<br /><br />I submit for your consideration &ldquo;<a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/162">The art of creating creatures</a>&rdquo;.</p>
