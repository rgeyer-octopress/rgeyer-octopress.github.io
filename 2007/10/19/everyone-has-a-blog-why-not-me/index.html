<p>So, it seems like everyone I know has a blog and/or a set of accounts on a myriad of social networking sites.  In most cases, I don&rsquo;t think they have anything interesting to say.<br /><br />For that matter, I don&rsquo;t think I have anything interesting to say.  However, I do have random thoughts, and epiphanies which I&rsquo;d like to document, even if no one is interested in reading them.<br /><br />I&rsquo;ll likely talk about just about anything that interests me here.  Things like computer hardware/software and software engineering stuff, automobiles, electronics, being &ldquo;green&rdquo;, and my family.<br /><br />I&rsquo;m also hoping to improve my skills with the written word in the wonderfully complex english language.  Maybe I&rsquo;ll be able to convey information more easily in emails and such.<br /><br />At any rate, read and enjoy if you like or totally ignore my random thoughts and rants, it&rsquo;s up to you.  Besides I&rsquo;m not even sure who (you) are, and I&rsquo;ll probably have to actively link people here in order for anyone to read it.  ;&ndash;)</p>
