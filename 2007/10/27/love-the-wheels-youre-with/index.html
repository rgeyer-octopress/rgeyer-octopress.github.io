<p>My wife and I have interesting personalities, we both make BIG decisions with fairly little hesitancy and generally don&rsquo;t regret the outcome.  However, on the little stuff, like where we eat for dinner, what color blankets to buy, and (for me especially) what we drive and how it&rsquo;s modified/maintained, we agonize and flip-flop constantly.<br /><br />See, I grew up in a family with a pretty strong &ldquo;car culture&rdquo;, and we generally bought used cars and modified them, or drove them until they gave up, and replaced them.  As a result, we owned A LOT of cars.  I personally went through about six (6) until I got my most recent, and newest vehicle.  For S&amp;G&rsquo;s, here&rsquo;s the list.<br /><br />1967 Ford Thunderbird &ldquo;Fordor&rdquo; &amp; matching parts car<br />1980&rsquo;s Dodge Ram D50 Pickup 4x4<br />1953 Dodge M37 Military Vehicle w/ 318cuid engine conversion<br />1988-89 Suzuki Samurai 4x4 &ldquo;soft top&rdquo;<br />1989 Honda CRX Si<br /><br />I now drive a 1999 Ford Explorer Eddie Bauer, which is a car I lusted after for several years before I was finally able to purchase the one I have.  I&rsquo;ve also been in a position to do more custom work, and add more aftermarket parts to this vehicle than any other in my past.  It&rsquo;s also been the most reliable.<br /><br />However, even though there is still custom stuff I&rsquo;d like to do with my truck, I find myself thinking &ldquo;how cool&rdquo; it would be to own X Y or Z instead, even though I&rsquo;d want to customize that as well.  It&rsquo;s a sort of addiction I think.<br /><br />With that said, I&rsquo;ve had a couple of epiphany moments.  The first came from the December edition of Hot Rod magazine, where one of the editors described how he used to only consider buying and restoring/modifying classic and muscle cars which were coupes, and usually only those that were factory hot rods.  But more recently, he&rsquo;s started to buy off models, and sedans and realizing that they are just as satisfying (and much cheaper) to own and wrench on.<br /><br />The second, was while watching the latest installment of the &ldquo;Street Customs&rdquo; TV series.  A (fairly affluent) customer brought in an early 90&rsquo;s Camero convertible for customization.  I found myself thinking &ldquo;why in the WORLD would you be interested in modifying, much less owning and driving that boring car?&rdquo;.  Then it occurred to me, it&rsquo;s the vehicle they had, and they wanted to make it special, personalized, and something they could be proud of.<br /><br />So, here I am with my &ldquo;dream car&rdquo; of about 6-7 years ago, and I can&rsquo;t just focus on enjoying it?  Is it because I think it isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;cool enough&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s not a sports car, or something else rare and  desirable?  Maybe&hellip;.  Maybe it&rsquo;s just my addiction to cars that prevents me from being satisfied, but I&rsquo;m starting to appreciate the philosophy of &ldquo;Love the one you&rsquo;re with&rdquo; as it applies to the car(s) I own.<br /><br />My Explorer meets all my needs, fits my 6&#8217; 4&#8221; frame and does a reasonable job of going around turns, looking good, and accelerating.  My biggest complaint is fuel economy.  I&rsquo;m hoping/planning to eventually swap a diesel motor into this vehicle for fuel economy and performance, probably some time after several of the &ldquo;medium duty&rdquo; diesels become available in 2010.  Specifically, the 4.5L Duramax GM has announced for it&rsquo;s &frac12; ton trucks.<br /><br />Compared to spending $25k &ndash; $30k on another vehicle that I&rsquo;d still want to modify and customize, spending a few thousand on a motor swap, and a few other &ldquo;touches&rdquo; on my existing vehicle seems reasonable.<br /><br />Meanwhile, I need to relax, and realize that I&rsquo;m driving something I thought was unobtainable only a few years ago.  And, that I&rsquo;ve customized it in ways I had never thought I could afford either.</p>
