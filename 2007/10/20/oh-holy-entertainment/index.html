<p>When I still lived with my parents, and didn&rsquo;t pay rent, a large portion of my income went toward entertainment related electronics.  Specifically home theater components.<br /><br />I also worked for a while at a high end audio/video shop that sold and provided custom installation services for obscenely expensive gear.  At the time, I was quite passionate about it, and read a lot of the industry news and and publications which elevated the experience of listening to music to an almost mystic and quasi-religious status.<br /><br />Years have past, I&rsquo;ve sold a lot of the high end gear I owned (used to have a full blow surround system with preamp and power amplifier separates), and gotten married and I&rsquo;m now starting a family.  I still very much enjoy music, and watching movies but at the moment I&rsquo;m fairly satisfied with the &ldquo;Home-Theater-In-A-Box&rdquo; (HTIAB) which I currently own for sound and video reproduction.<br /><br />I recently started shopping for a new Flat Panel TV considering the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_television_in_the_United_States">government mandated change</a> to HD for all broadcast TV.  As part of my exercise of researching TV&rsquo;s and making a purchasing decision, I recently subscribed to <a href="http://www.hometheatermag.com/">Home Theater Magazine</a> one of the industry publications I had previously studied carefully.<br /><br />Where I used to completely agree with their assertions, and at times even look down my nose at the authors as &ldquo;posers&rdquo;, I now find myself offended by the haughty and elitist attitude which permeates the articles I read.  I feel as though, rather than being my peers and people that &ldquo;get me&rdquo; I&rsquo;m reading material from authors who would label me a heretic for putting &ldquo;real life&rdquo; ahead of the pursuit of excruciatingly expensive electronic equipment for the sole purpose of reproducing sound waves.<br /><br />Now, don&rsquo;t get me wrong, if I could afford it, I&rsquo;d still probably be &ldquo;one of them&rdquo; and own the most esoteric and temperamental gear in pursuit of the perfect movie or music experience.  But as it is, I can&rsquo;t.  I can afford my &ldquo;high end&rdquo; HTIAB and for the most part I&rsquo;m happy with it.  I also don&rsquo;t need to worry about the neighbors banging on the door because I&rsquo;m playing it too loud.  I don&rsquo;t need to worry that my rooms acoustics aren&rsquo;t doing my $10,000 a pair main monitors justice.  I don&rsquo;t need to worry that my baby son will put peanut butter in the tray of my fancy new BluRay and HD-DVD player, destroying a $2500 investment.<br /><br />Perhaps I&rsquo;ve lost perspective on the passion and experience I so eagerly pursued in the past.  But then, have I really lost that much?</p>
