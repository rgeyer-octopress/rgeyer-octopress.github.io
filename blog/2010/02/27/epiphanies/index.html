<div class="entry-content">I have been having a whole lot of epiphanies of late.  Be it about the new chores I have to take care of, I&#8217;m still figuring all that out but to be honest I am really getting the hang of them.  I am still learning to change with Q&#8217;s wants and needs.  I&#8217;m sure all these years of learning and growing with the hubs has helped me a great deal.  I&#8217;m still trying to figure out life and the meaning of it for me and my role as mother, wife, friend, sister, daughter and grand daughter.  I&#8217;m thinking that I may have to continue to experiment.  

I&#8217;m starting to realize all over again that I know nothing at all.  I keep learning more and more and feeling like maybe I have a handle on life and then again I find myself surprised and feeling clueless all over again.

What brought all this on?  I&#8217;m at a new cross roads.  In the not too distant future we will be welcoming a new family member to our home and I&#8217;m still trying to figure out just how we will approach this change.  The first question everyone has is how am I going to go about my recover from delivery.  I am sure that this time I will do all I can not to try to jump back into full swing of things until a couple weeks postpartum.  I&#8217;m simply determined to focus on my new beautiful addition and my beautiful big boy and my incredible husband.

The other question that keeps coming up is will I be working after having our newest bundle of joy and I have yet to figure out the answer to that one.  The hubs has made his decision and though I think it is sweet I&#8217;m not sure if that works best for our family.  We shall see.  

I guess it all goes back to the entire stay at home mom vs. the working mom debate.  I love contributing financially to my family.  I love my job.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong, my job is tough, even stressful but I do get something out of my job that is really satisfying.  On the other hand, the idea of staying home with my babies, keeping a home and leaving the money making to the hubs is exciting.  There is so much I fee like I am missing from the day to day with my toddler.  I can only imagine what I would miss from his relationship with his newest sibling.  I enjoyed my 10 weeks home with Q and I am excited about having at least as much time with our newest baby.  I&#8217;m already dreading leaving my boys for work.  But there is still the question if I will be as good of a mom without work.  I am able to drop everything quickly to play with or cuddle my son.  Will I be so quick to do that without my working?  Do I get some kind of down time or selfish time when at work when all I have to think about is work and the goal directly in front of me?

The epiphany here is that maybe just maybe things in this aspect of life aren&#8217;t so straight forward.  If you asked me five years ago I would have told you that I had every intention of being a stay at home mom from the moment I found out that I was pregnant.  That I just couldn&#8217;t ever imagine working once I had my first child.  Now, shockingly, I have no idea what the plan is while I am expecting my second child.  I just want what is best for my family and I am still trying to figure out just what that means to our family.

I&#8217;m still trying to figure out what is best for me.  With my myriad of health problems I know that pushing too hard is a huge detriment to myself.  I&#8217;m starting to really take the time to stop and rest.  I&#8217;m figuring out what my body needs and how to meet those needs.  I&#8217;m learning to put myself as a priority, which is incredibly hard as a mother.  

The big epiphany is there is just so much to figure out and that I may NEVER figure it all out and that is ok.  That is half the fun of this ride we call life.  Don&#8217;t worry, in time you will hear me spout lots of stories about my boobies again.  What did you think I would post without mentioning my boobs?  LOL!  Yeah, no, not going to happen, after all I&#8217;m a mom. :-P
