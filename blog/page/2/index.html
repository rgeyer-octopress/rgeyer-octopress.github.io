<h2>date: 2011-08-14 00:00:00 -0700</h2>

<p>I have been a stay at home mom for a little over a year now and my world seriously revolves around the needs and wants of my children and errands and chores from 8-5 every day, if not longer.  My focus is interacting, teaching, and molding the young minds left in my care until they are grown by my standards.  This includes learning how to play keep the playdoh out of the baby&rsquo;s mouth and out of electronics.  Learning about a huge selection of good music and learning what they prefer.   The result?  This once ever so interesting woman that had interesting things to say is so tired and most of my ideas are hibernating by the time I get a chance to have a real adult conversation.</p>

<p>This means that when my ever so intelligent husband gets home he is often greeted by our adorable boys with open arms and squeals of joy while I take a deep breath and prepare to be a listening ear.  Now, I love and adore my husband and he is an very intelligent man, like bordering on genius intelligent, so there is a degree of preparing myself to hear what he has to say.  When your day is filled with nursery rhymes and instructing your children on what is and is not acceptable, like no, shoving your brother off the couch is not ok even if you feel like he&rsquo;s taking up too much room, my great and hilarious epiphanies have faded in the background.</p>

<p>My husband comes home eager to talk about his day at work, he loves his job, and I am thankful for it.  I seriously make mental notes while he talks about things I could learn more about, I have even been known to google something he has mentioned in passing.  I try to participate but my background is in culinary arts, dental practices, and the very basic HR and management principles while my husband is all about code, security and cloud computing.  We hit a common ground with cars and technology but we are on different plains there too, thankfully there are a slew of other topics we talk about but at the end of the day I am so knee deep in potty training, diaper changing, and all things childcaring related I am just happy to hear an adult talk to me about adult things.</p>

<p>Every day I attempt to watch the news, maybe a documentary, something that is relevant or up to date but it is an attempt.  I fall asleep during the late night news, I&rsquo;m half awake for the early morning news while stealing a little more sleep after nursing my youngest before my eldest wakes up.  I try to watch the evening news while making and serving dinner to my boys.  I look at the news sites both national and local but Lordy that only lasts a few minutes too.  The running joke with my mom about movies or shows we watch streaming is that though I may have &lsquo;watched&rsquo; said thing a couple of times, I have yet to watch it completely.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m trying to stay interesting to myself and that is a feat within it&rsquo;s self.  I&rsquo;m going to do it, I&rsquo;m determined to do it, now if only we could get an extra five hours in a day I would be golden.</p>

<p>For visitors to your blog, one of the biggest factors that contributes to the load time of the page is the static content.  Stuff like pictures, CSS, Javascript files, etc.</p>

<p>One of the best ways you can improve this performance is to serve those things from a Content Delivery Network (CDN).  Follow along as I show you how to configure your Wordpress blog to use Amazon S3 as a CDN for delivering static content!</p>

<h2>date: 2011-07-02 00:00:00 -0700</h2>

<p>So we&rsquo;ve been renting a house for a bit over a year and a half.  As a techie and an obsessive tinkerer, this means an excuse to start buying tools and other things in the name of &ldquo;maintaining the house&rdquo;.</p>

<h1>How it all began</h1>


<p>One such tool which we recently bought was an electric weed whacker.  About two months ago, the weed whacker needed it&rsquo;s wire spool replaced.  In the interest of speed, I popped the plastic cover off of the spool, and removed the screw in the center of the spool (thinking it was necessary to get the spool off), all while standing in the grass.</p>

<p><em>Big Mistake</em></p>

<p>I set the plastic cover down in the grass, and put the screw right in the center of it as I replaced the spool.  Meanwhile Q is running around and playing with everything in his sight and grasp.  I should have been paying more attention to him, but I didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p><em>Really&hellip; Really <strong>BIG</strong> mistake</em></p>

<p>When I got the new spool in, I looked down to the grass beside me expecting to grab my screw and plastic cap and reassemble the weed whacker.  But it was <em><strong>gone</strong></em>..</p>

<p>I yelled to Q and he came running, plastic cap in hand.</p>

<p>The next 30 minutes or so consisted of me interrogating the poor boy on the whereabouts of my screw, and then a futile search for it in the grass.</p>

<h1>How I became a vandal</h1>


<p>Which brings us to today.  I was in Home Depot picking up some misc. stuff, and thought I&rsquo;d try a last ditch effort to find a replacement for that screw.  Since it isn&rsquo;t a wear part, and you aren&rsquo;t supposed to remove it when replacing the wire spool, they don&rsquo;t sell a replacement.</p>

<p>Fortunately though, they DID have the exact model that I bought on display.</p>

<p><em>Do you see where this is going yet?</em></p>

<p>So here I am in a Home Depot with no available replacement for my screw, but a new weed whacker of the exact same model right in front of me.  If only I could somehow see the screw I had lost and go over to hardware to find a replacement.</p>

<p><em>So it begins</em></p>

<p>So, I casually wander over the the tool department and grab a screwdriver.  I then saunter back over to the garden center with my screwdriver in hand.</p>

<p>Watching over my shoulder, and setting Q as a lookout, I quickly remove the screw from the floor model.  Next stop, hardware.</p>

<p>With my ill gotten screw in hand I head over to the hardware department.  I identify the size and thread pitch of the screw, and grab a couple screws that match it.</p>

<p>Then it&rsquo;s back to the garden center to return the screw I &ldquo;borrowed&rdquo;, and back to the tool corral to return my screwdriver.</p>

<p><em>Mission accomplished</em></p>

<p>I am now happy to report that I now have a fully operational weed whacker again, thanks to a quick covert operation in our local Home Depot!</p>

<p>Now that Amazon&rsquo;s Identity and Access Management (<a href="http://aws.amazon.com/iam/">IAM</a>) is more widely known, and you can use your IAM credentials to <a href="/2011/04/04/enabling-aws-console-login-for-iam-users/">login to the AWS Console</a>, you might be wondering how to really leverage the IAM offering.</p>

I know I have been talking soooo much about my eldest son, the amazing three year old that has accomplished sooo much in the potty training arena.  I have to say a few things about my baby boy.</p>

<p>I am in awe over this child and know that I will be trying to keep up with him for the rest of my life.  He is a climber.  Like, the kid doesn&rsquo;t walk yet (buries head in sand over the steps he ran and walked randomly) and yet he climbs everything he can get his hands on.  We like to go to a park that has the little play ground and the big play ground.  My baby boy has shown his climbing prowess by climbing the big play ground trying to keep up with his brother that is nearly 2.5 years older than him.</p>

<p>He is amazing.  Oh and he talks.  I am not the delusional parent convinced he speaks well, he is learning and is a great mimic.  He loves to try to enunciate nearly every word that he hears. <em>makes note to clean up the music listened to around him</em>  He is amazing.  Oh and he is an eater.  My first son was only interested in nursing for the first full year of his life.  My second?  He loves to chill at the BF cafe when he can but he also wants a bite of that burger his mom is eating  while nursing him.  Epic.</p>

<p>So he is &lsquo;nearly&rsquo; walking (I&rsquo;m still not willing to say otherwise), he crawls ridiculously fast, he climbs everything he can and I&rsquo;m hoping he loves a diversity of good food, so far so good. :D</p>

<p>I just adore my boys, adore.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s being all awesome and doing all he can on his own.  I had no idea he would do so well.</p>

<p>I mean I knew he could do it but I had no idea he would just embrace the process so willingly and be so self sufficient.</p>

<p>He is awesome.</p>

<p>I am proud.</p>

<p>I officially have a giant grin on my face so big that even my baby is grinning since that is what you are supposed to do when someone uses the potty correctly.  Yay!</p>

<p>We did the scariest thing ever!  We took both boys grocery shopping while one was diaperless!  Scary stuff, huh?  We went grocery shopping without both boys last week, yes we were big chickens, so what!</p>

<p>My big boy was doing well all day with the potty training, you know acting like he&rsquo;s been doing this for years.  He even had attitude with me when I asked if he needed to use the potty, he rolled his eyes and told me I was silly since he had just peed a few minutes ago.  <em>Epic</em>.</p>

<p>Back to grocery shopping.  We weren&rsquo;t used to this process and both my husband and I spaced on offering a potty break at the first store.  We went to the second store with our eldest son recovering from grocery cart regret, he didn&rsquo;t use the cart with the plastic car on the front per his request to &ldquo;Be like Mommy and Daddy&rdquo;, then lost his mind when he saw another kid riding in it.</p>

<p>So our first trip to a commercial toilet, I was nervous and my son was excited.  We ran to the bathroom since my son announced he had to pee NOW.  I saw the womens bathroom was occupied so I figured having my son with me authorized us to use the mens bathroom.  It worked out nicely and so far my son isn&rsquo;t petrified of those evil automatic flushing toilets.  We did in fact high five after washing our hands and grocery shopping was narrated by my son.</p>

<p>He is just so happy with himself but has this air to him that just says, &lsquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m just that awesome.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Yeah, my son was a rock start today.</p>

<p>He proudly would announce that he used the potty all by himself, with a dance.  Yes, I had to escort him back to the bathroom to wash his hands and wash my own hands since I high fived him with glee before remembering that he can&rsquo;t turn the faucet on by himself.</p>

<p>Yes my son was a potty trained big boy and for the umpteenth time I have realized that my children are growing before my very eyes and it is happening way too fast but this is the wild ride I volunteered for.</p>

<p>For now I&rsquo;m just going to enjoy a song and dance with my son potty training skillZ, yeah with a capital <strong>Z</strong>.</p>

<p>Yesterday was horrid, just horrid as everyone was struggling with the emotional turmoil of the accidents.  Yes, even the baby realized that everyone was having a hard time.  It&rsquo;s amazing how your child has an accident and you try to focus all your energy on making it right and yet you, as a mother, find the time to beat yourself up for dropping the ball and possibly not give your kid enough time and attention.</p>

<p>Today, we are getting better, much better.  My son started the day with an accident and a shower and I had a load of laundry to do before doing anything.  We followed it up with being my son then being way too confident with his bladder control and having a moment where he forgot to take his pants off while peeing.  From that point on he was showing his prowess, kicking butt and taking names and kept things dry everywhere but in the potty.</p>

<p>You are so happy you stumbled over this blog right now.  I mean, I can just see the techie followers of my husband wondering what in the hell they came across.  You can thank my ever so wonderful husband for sharing this space with his stay at home mom wife to share the joys of pees and poops and lactating boobies and other fantastical bodily functions.  Go ahead, take a minute to thank him. :-P</p>
