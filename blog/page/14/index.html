  <div class="entry-content">Over the past couple of months, I&#8217;ve been transitioning a lot of my normal computing activities to the internet.  What I mean by this, is where I used to use some software based solution for something that had to be installed on every computer I used, or had to be used on only a single computer I&#8217;m now using a web based solution.

For instance.  I used to manage my email through Mozilla Thunderbird on my home computer.  This worked fairly well for me and allowed me to filter spam etc.  But in all reality, I really want to be able to access my email anywhere, anytime, with any computer.  I&#8217;ve now redirected most of my email addresses by either forwarding, or using gmail&#8217;s POP3 functionality, and it&#8217;s much nicer to manage my email this way, not to mention the ability to search archived stuff way cool!

I&#8217;ve also had an ongoing problem of managing my contacts and calendar on my windows mobile based cell phone.  You see, the &#8220;standard&#8221; way to keep this thing synchronized is to use some variety of Microsoft Outlook, and their anti intuitive and very painful ActiveSync.  The problem of course is, only one computer can be the &#8220;master&#8221; which you synchronize with, and if you try to sync with another you run the very real risk of deleting appointments or contacts on either your phone or the computer.  Enter <a href="http://www.goosync.com/">goosync</a>.  Leveraging my aforementioned move to gmail, I can now synchronize my phone (over the wireless internet connection I&#8217;m paying for) with my google calendar and contacts.  Sweet!

How about social networking?  Well I&#8217;ve had a MySpace profile for some time, though I rarely visit it and I&#8217;m seriously considering getting rid of it.  However, I&#8217;ve recently discovered (and become addicted) to <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a>.  I find that their particular implementation of social networking seems to allow you to use this for &#8220;professional&#8221; purposes and mostly dodge the less desirable social networking behavior that turned me off from MySpace in the first place.  As a software developer I&#8217;m also very attracted to the open API architecture and the multitude of very well written applications, in fact I&#8217;m just waiting for the inspiration to hit me so that I can write my own.

Another consequence of joining Facebook is that I (re) discovered <a href="http://www.pandora.com">Pandora Radio</a>.  I had given Pandora a test drive when it was first released, and only the &#8220;QuickMix&#8221; was available.  I was fairly disappointed after only a few minutes of using it and quickly dismissed it as just another over hyped new &#8220;Web 2.0&#8221; app.  When I noticed that there was a Facebook application for it though, and noticed that what my friends were listening to showed up as status updates I was intrigued, and gave it another try.  This time I was able to create my own station, seeded by artists and songs that I liked.  Having only supplied one artist seed I found myself LOVING every last song that was played on a station.  I now listen to it exclusively where I used to listen to the &#8220;chillout&#8221; station over at <a href="http://www.di.fm">Digitally Imported</a> using Winamp.  Still another step away from desktop apps!

One disappointment I have with Facebook however, is that while it does allow you to upload unlimited pictures, and share the albums publicly, it does not have any screen showing all of your public albums.  For instance, I can share and link you to <a href="http://www.new.facebook.com/album.php?aid=3616&l=53ace&id=1344570211">this album</a> containing some artistic shots, but I have several other public albums that you&#8217;d never know about, unless I directly linked those as well.

In order to remedy that I&#8217;m evaluating using some other online photo management service like <a href="http://picasa.google.com/">Picasa</a> then linking it back to my Facebook account.  It&#8217;s a real shame though since I think that Facebook offers an ease of use that so far I haven&#8217;t seen in the alternatives.

My last discovery in the world of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing">Cloud Computing</a> has been a password management system.  You see, I have more logins than I could possibly keep track of, in fact I&#8217;m CERTAIN that I have logins to forums and other sites that I don&#8217;t even remember exist.  As a result, I have the same problem of remembering passwords that many computer users experience, and I&#8217;m not great about picking unique passwords!  To resolve that I went looking for some good online password management.  Now, I&#8217;ve conducted this search before, and come up wanting for security or functionality in the solutions I&#8217;ve found.  Not so this time!

Allow me to introduce <a href="http://www.passpack.com/info/home/">Passpack</a>.  What I like about this is that it uses a lot of AJAX, and consequently the information I enter is encrypted in my browser before it even hits the wire!  Very cool.  It also has the ability to generate strong passwords then automatically enter them for me at the login prompt for the website!  I could go on about the features for a while but I&#8217;ll save that for another blog entry when/if I feel so inclined.  If your interested, or conducting your own search for an online password manager I recommend Passpack, go ahead and follow the link over there and check it out.

  <div class="entry-content">This Labor Day weekend I finally put the finishing touches on my wife&#8217;s Lexus ES300.  You see, about 5 weeks earlier I had started the seemingly simple task of removing the cylinder heads, and replacing them with a rebuilt pair I had practically stolen from a seller on eBay.

The goal of course, was to fix the valve stem seal leak(s) and what I thought was a valve cover leak &#8220;once and for all&#8221;.  Suffice to say there were some complications and unanticipated distractions during the several weekends it took to get it done.

The result?  I&#8217;ve replaced the two broken motor mounts I found, got the pretty new heads installed, replaced the timing belt, installed new spark plugs, and replaced the master and slave cylinders for the hydraulic clutch.  The car is running much better, and no longer billows a big blue cloud of smoke when being started up.

However, the passenger side axle still has a broken CV boot which I have a replacement for, but may not get to for another couple weekends and&#8230;.  The oil leak I had assumed was the valve cover gaskets turns out to have been something else.  At the moment I&#8217;m suspecting the oil pan gasket, I&#8217;m hoping to fully diagnose it and possibly tackle the replacement next weekend.  I&#8217;m going to take this weekend to relax!

  <div class="entry-content">I just placed the first of two orders for the components to my new desktop machine!

This upgrade is sorely overdue, the last time I got a &#8220;new&#8221; machine was about 3 years ago and it was antiquated then.  So I&#8217;m going from my 2.4GHZ P4 with 1GB RAM and an assortment of various drives to this new beast I&#8217;m building.

This first order was for a 24&#8221; Widescreen LCD, Ergo keyboard, speakers, and a gigabit switch.  I also ordered a power supply and some fans for an different project entirely.  The total cost shipped was $631.53 with about $50 representing stuff not associated with this upgrade.

The rest of the parts will consist of a 2.4GHZ Intel Core Quad Processor, 8GB RAM, a 500GB drive, Vista Ultimate 64, and a fairly run of the mill 512MB Nvidia GeForce 9500 GT.

Sadly, still not &#8220;bleeding edge&#8221; but certainly a big step up from what I&#8217;ve got.  I&#8217;m hoping to enjoy it&#8217;s speed when doing stuff like non linear video editing of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDV">HDV</a> from my camcorder using <a href="http://cinelerra.org/">Cinelerra</a>.  I&#8217;m sure I won&#8217;t be disappointed, and I&#8217;ll be sure to post results here, so stay tuned for more!

  <div class="entry-content">Okay, so I&#8217;ve been a little bit out of the loop on the new Corvette ZR1 in spite of being a Motor Trend subscriber.

Bottom line, this is the fastest car the General has ever produced in any quantity for public consumption.  You can read all about Motor Trend&#8217;s first drive <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/coupes/112_0810_2009_chevrolet_corvette_zr1_first_drive/index.html">here</a>.

However, my very favorite part is in the first paragraph of <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/coupes/112_0810_2009_chevrolet_corvette_zr1_first_drive/brakes_and_tires.html">this</a> page, where they reveal that every new ZR1 owner will be given the opportunity to attend a free high performance driving school!

It&#8217;s good to see Chevy taking a proactive approach to educating their customers, particularly when planting them behind the wheel of something as quick as the ZR1.  It&#8217;s not exactly what I proposed <a href="http://www.nslms.com/2008/03/11/check-out-my-new-ride/">here</a>, namely that I should be able to buy a car like the ZR1 if I was able to demonstrate my ability to handle it and my overall enthusiasm for the car, but it&#8217;s certainly a step in the right direction.  Hey Chevy, how &#8216;bout if I finish a course with Bob Bondurant &#8220;with honors&#8221; you offer me a discounted ZR1?  Yeah&#8230;  Right..

      <p class="meta">

  <div class="entry-content">I recently had to deal with the problem of ADO.NET data access occurring on user controls, and forms in the Visual Studio design view.  Now the data access depended upon a connection string in the App.config file and consequently, when run from Visual Studio it could not connect to the database since the connection string wasn&#8217;t available.

So, I proceeded to do some searching on the problem.  I very quickly discovered the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.componentmodel.component.designmode.aspx">DesignMode</a> flag for components, and thought I&#8217;d found my solution.

I promptly added the following to the UserControl that was blowing up when I opened it in the Designer.

<pre lang="csharp" line="1">
public UserControlCtor()
{
     InitializeComponent();
     if(!DesignMode)
     {
          // Do the data access here.
     }
}
</pre>

I quickly discovered however, that the DesignMode flag wasn&#8217;t set until AFTER the constructor had run, and the parent object set the DesignMode flag on this control.  Okay, simple enough we just move it to the OnLoad event for the UserControl right?  Well, yes that would probably work in most cases however in our application this practice of doing data access in the constructors was rampant and therefore the dozen or so UserControls that were placed on this UserControl had the same problem.  I&#8217;d need to make the this change to&#8230; well&#8230; pretty much every UserControl in the application.  While that&#8217;s something that should happen, right now we cannot afford the <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebt.html">technical debt</a> to fix it.

Fortunately, all of our ADO.NET access in this application is abstracted into a library class which does all the data access, and handles things like opening and closing/disposing the database connection and just generally insulating users from the complexities of using ADO.NET.  That&#8217;s the obvious candidate for the best place to filter design or runtime mode and either run the data access or not.

But wait, a helper class in the app won&#8217;t have a DesignMode flag and besides, how would it get set, you say?  Well, in my travels looking for ways to detect that the code is running in design mode, I stumbled across several solutions.  The most intriguing of which is the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.componentmodel.licensemanager.usagemode.aspx">UsageMode</a> flag.  This can be checked in any class at any time and gives you an accurate gauge of what mode your code is running in.

So, in the few methods that do the data access in our ADO.NET abstracting class, I simply do the following.

<pre lang="csharp" line="1">
if(System.ComponentModel.LicenseManager.UsageMode ==
   System.ComponentModel.LicenseUsageMode.Designtime)
     return;
</pre>

This checks to see if we&#8217;re in design mode or not, and if we are simply bails out of the method effectively skipping the data access and solving our problem.  Pretty cool eh?

I found several suggestions on how to detect design mode, they pretty much consisted of the following.
<ol>
  <li><a href="http://www.euforik.com/blog/post/2008/07/Knowing-if-youre-in-design-mode.aspx">Check the DesignMode Flag</a>
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://devintelligence.com/blogs/netadventures/archive/2005/04/29/620.aspx">Check if the current process is Visual Studio</a>
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://www.devnewsgroups.net/group/microsoft.public.dotnet.framework.windowsforms/topic4403.aspx">Check the UsageMode Flag</a>
  </li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content">Just felt <a href="http://quake.wr.usgs.gov/recenteqs/Quakes/ci14383980.html">this</a> earthquake here in Santa Barbara.

It was surprisingly long, and USGS is reporting that there were several aftershocks within a few minutes, all right around a 3 magnitude.

Certainly no damage or injuries here (that have been reported), and I just got word from someone in the &#8220;City of Industry&#8221; in LA who says everything is fine there as well.

Woo!

  <div class="entry-content">Well, we visited the apartment yesterday afternoon, and found that the wind had reversed and the fire line had moved back nearly to the peak of the foothills behind our neighborhood.  Consequently, the smoke and ash too had receded and were being blow in the opposite direction.  In fact, it looked almost like a normal sunny afternoon!

Since we had packed a few things, and had laundry to do we went back to my mother-in-laws place, and wound up spending the night again.  However we&#8217;re likely to be back in our apartment this afternoon/evening.

The fire is still just over 8,000 acres and is 24% contained.  Still a reasonable danger of it threatening Goleta, but at the moment it&#8217;s a much bigger threat to the rural neighborhoods in the foothills.

So far so good!

  <div class="entry-content">As many of you may know, we live in Goleta California.  Over the past 5 days a wild fire has been raging in the foothills of Goleta.

The fire has burned over 8,000 acres and 20 structures as of this writing.  The fire is ~5-6 miles North by North West from our apartment at the moment, though there is no evacuation warning nor order for our neighborhood.  In fact, there is a Red Cross shelter setup on just the other side of the freeway from us at San Marcos High School.  There is an evacuation warning for the neighborhood just 1/2 mile north of our apartment.

We choose to grab some important things, and leave our apartment last night due to the air quality and power outages we were experiencing.  Power has been going off during the night for several hours at a time for the past 5 days since the fire started.  That combined with a requirement to keep all our doors and windows closed in order to keep the smoke and ash out caused out apartment to become unbearably hot.  We spent the night at my mother-in-laws place last night, and we&#8217;ll likely be going back home this afternoon to see how the air quality etc. is.

At the moment, we&#8217;re not particularly concerned that our home is at risk, but the ash/smoke and power outages is making it uncomfortable and at times impossible to stay home.  Our kingdom hall is only a few feet south of the road that is used as the demarcation line for the evacuation warnings, so our meetings and field service have been canceled for the holiday weekend.

Exciting times to be sure, but we&#8217;re doing fine.  I&#8217;ll try to keep everyone up to date by means of this blog.  You can also find regular updates about the fire stats on our <a href="http://www.keyt.com/news/local/22836584.html">local news website</a>.

  <div class="entry-content">So my wife and I have this meal tonight.  It consists of one of those <a href="http://www.bertolli.us/classicdinners.aspx">Bertolli dinners in a bag</a>, a salad and some bread, accompanied by the recommended wine pairing (Chianti).

After completing it, we had some pastries made by <a href="http://entenmanns.gwbakeries.com/">Entenmanns</a>.  And no, we don&#8217;t usually eat so much easily prepared food, we actually do know how to cook and my wife actually completed culinary school, we were just lazy tonight.

So as we&#8217;re taking the last bites of our extraordinarily rich and sweet desserts my wife turns to me and says;

&#8220;You know what would really finish this meal?&#8221;

&#8220;Coffee?!&#8221; I say sarcastically since she teased me about not making some to go with dessert only moments ago.

&#8220;No&#8221;

&#8220;Milk?&#8221;

&#8220;Close&#8221; she says.

&#8220;What?&#8221; I ask&#8230;

&#8220;Pickle&#8221;

Let that sink in&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;

Clearly the perfect complement to our dessert will be a big salty and vinegary pickle!  Needless to say I laughed till I cried, then vowed to blog the incident for all to enjoy.

My wife insists that I clarify that she meant that the perfect compliment to the entire meal from start to finish would be a pickle.  I still find the combination hilarious.

  <div class="entry-content">I just learned about a Bash History Meme originated at <a href="http://planet.fedoraproject.org/">Planet Fedora</a> from a <a href="http://basildoncoder.com/blog/">blog</a> I read regularly.

In short, you run the following command in bash, and show your results.

<pre lang="bash">
history | awk '{a[$2]++ } END{for(i in a){print a[i] " " i}}'|sort -rn|head
</pre>

My results from my home box are as follows;
<pre lang="bash">
103 ls
59 cd
52 exit
38 vi
38 firefox
29 for
22 su
18 /opt/hdv/myworkflow.sh
14 ssh
13 diff
</pre>

Seems I&#8217;m unwilling to simply close my terminal window in KDE, but instead have to type &#8220;exit&#8221;.  The &#8220;myworkflow.sh&#8221; script is a work in progress which I hope to one day post about.  It does stuff to help me convert and do post production on video from my HDV camcorder.  I&#8217;ve been using &#8220;diff&#8221; to compare original files with modified ones for web updates I&#8217;ve been doing for clients.

Here&#8217;s the results from my web hosting box;
<pre lang="bash">
394 ls
212 cd
89 vi
77 exit
60 du
30 mv
28 rm
20 mkdir
19 pwd
12 cp
</pre>

Suppose there&#8217;s nothing particularly interesting here.  I was checking a file upload progress in a very nasty way by calling &#8220;du&#8221;, what can I say..  I&#8217;m lazy.
