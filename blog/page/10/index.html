<h2>date: 2010-05-03 00:00:00 -0700</h2>

<p>I get this question often.  May it be about how it feels to be mixed in race, being in an &lsquo;interracial&rsquo; marriage (not sure about that definition as both my husband and I are Caucasian but if the Mexican and African American throws you off :shrugs:), being married, being a mom, being pregnant, and being sick.  I get this question often.</p>

<p>I have an illness.  I was diagnosed three years ago with Multiple Sclerosis.  I have to admit that day is etched in my memory with amazing clarity.  I had found out I was pregnant just a couple weeks before.  I had been seeing doctors and doing tests like it was my full time job for months prior to that.  We had been searching for an answer as to why my health problems seemed to be getting worse in waves and then suddenly improving with time and rest for five years.  I was just going to be happy with an answer at this point, was ready to welcome any answer that verified that my health problems were real and had a name.  I walked in the room with my heart beating hard and waited.  The neurologist took a deep breath and told me I had Multiple Sclerosis.  My husband and I sighed a sigh of relief and laughed.  I think we caught my doctor off guard.  She didn&rsquo;t know us that well, I had only been seeing her for a few months.  I was referred to her as my local neurologist wanted more input on my case.  She explained why she thought this was an accurate diagnosis, that I have a &lsquo;light&rsquo; case and started to talk about treatment and medication.</p>

<p>I stopped her in her tracks when I let her know that I was pregnant.  She smiled and gave us multiple pamphlets and wished us luck in our endeavors to care for our unborn child and my ill body.  I&rsquo;m not going to lie.  I read through the pamphlets decided on the course of action I wanted to take and let the paper work collect dust.  I was just too excited to be expecting my first child, our first child. :smiles: I felt really good for the first time in months.  I was explained that pregnancy has been known to stop this disease if not improve the life of one with this disease.  I was apparently one of the latter.</p>

<p>I had my baby, my beautiful baby boy.  One year passes and I saw my neurologist (my local one) and he asked me when I was going to either start medication or get pregnant again.  I looked at my husband who was grinning from ear to ear&hellip;I knew what he wanted.  I knew what I wanted and I told my doctor that I think we will be trying to conceive instead of taking medication.  My doctor smiled and said ok.  Nine months later I found out I was pregnant our second.  My health is ok, aside from the usual morning sickness, aches and pains of pregnancy and trying to keep up with an active toddler I have my hands full.</p>

<p>I have, since getting my diagnosis, got lots of questions.  I know there is so much information out there, a lot of dark and scary information.  I have dealt with just being tired all the time, finding out my limitations where greater than I ever imagined.  I have dealt with the aches and pains, the frustration when my body just demands that I stop or else.  The repercussions of doing too much in a day and paying for it for the next week.  The long list of vague and annoying symptoms when I am at my worst.  I don&rsquo;t like to answer those questions.  I have been blessed in so many different ways, I have a wonderful family, incredible husband and amazing children (yes I&rsquo;m making that assumption even before my second child is born because he already brings me so much joy).  I am thankful for all that I have, and I&rsquo;m determined not to allow health issues to stop that.  Though in my endevors of reading on mulitple forums I was shown this and the next time someone asks how it is, or what it&rsquo;s like to live with these challenges I think I will point them to this as it describes life with a long term illness:

<h2>date: 2010-04-28 00:00:00 -0700</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rgeyer/4369302088/" title="Tate Maternity by qwikrex, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4013/4369302088_65d899576b_m.jpg" width="240" height="166" alt="Tate Maternity" class="alignright" /></a>Now let it be said that I am not skinny, I haven&#8217;t been skinny for years.  Heck I haven&#8217;t weight 100lbs since puberty struck and I&#8217;m ok with that.  Thankfully I am happy with my body and I see room for improvement.  I am thrilled to say that the hubs is sweet on my current figure and has been a fan of my body for the entirety of our marriage.  I just hate how the topic of weight and size keeps coming up at the oddest times, I mean I&#8217;m at work and someone will ask me how my weight is going.  Um, I am in my third trimester in my second pregnancy, why the heck is it your business what my weight is?  Why is it now that I am carrying and supporting another life it&#8217;s ok for you to ask and then have an opinion about the fact that I am actually still down from the weight I was when I found out I was pregnant?!?  I&#8217;m not sure if this hormonal woman is ok with either response to this piece of information.  People may tell me, &#8216;Good for you!&#8217; :gives person blank stare: Are you trying to break it to me that you thought I was fat?  Are you just not a fan of women gaining weight to sustain healthy life?  Am I ready too much &#8216;jelly&#8217; for you?  Last time I looked in the mirror I looked good, darn good.  Last time I walked down the street to get somewhere I get smiles, from men and women appreciating that my form is to sustain another life.  Smiles because I&#8217;m happy and confident in who and what I am which is obvious in the way I hold myself.</p>




<p>The other answer which irritates me is &#8216;Are you eating enough?  I mean you have seen a doctor and they have said you aren&#8217;t hurting yourself or your child, right?&#8217;, really?  You think that I would take as much time to take care of myself but when I&#8217;m pregnant I wouldn&#8217;t go see a doctor regularly to be sure that both my unborn child and I are ok?  You would think that I would harm my baby or myself in some way?  I love my children, both my toddler and my unborn son.  They are a huge chunk of my everything.  I have seen a doctor as soon as they would see me for my current condition and have been reassured over and over that all is well and wonderful with both of us. </p>




<p>I know I gained some weight in my last pregnancy, and according to my OB that was healthy and good for both of us as my son&#8217;s growth was perfect.  I also know that I go out of my way to eat healthy daily and eat multiple meals and snacks daily in this pregnancy and my son has already showed signs of being a big strong child that will be born in a couple of months.  Was there ever concern about my lack of weight gain?  Sure, but I went to a specialist and he checked my youngest son&#8217;s growth and development and he is right on track for a above average fetus.  When we got that green light from him both my OB and I sighed a sigh of relief and have continued to see that this pregnancy has progressed well.</p>




<p>Now my goal for this pregnancy was to have a &#8216;skinny&#8217; pregnancy, meaning I was going to be back down to my wedding day weight and then get pregnant, then gain a beautiful amount of weight and be that really cute pregnant lady.  Due to complications of life and interesting health circumstances this didn&#8217;t work out.  When I found out I was pregnant I was over the moon, and I still am.  I got over the fact that I wouldn&#8217;t be able to shop at a trendy maternity store in town and just figured I&#8217;d be a bit curvier, like I was last time.  I embraced it and moved on.  I&#8217;m ok with it, but Lordy why do I have to explain where I&#8217;m at so often with, at times, complete strangers.   I know I&#8217;m a friendly person, I am generally cool with sharing but can&#8217;t I have a few off limit areas when I&#8217;m exhausted trying to be all I can be for my husband and my baby boys?</p>




<p>I have never regretted not weighing 100lbs or less since being an adult, I don&#8217;t look good under 120lbs.  I know, I have tried it out and I&#8217;m all skin and bones and my body resists it.  When I say resists it I ache from head to toe, I don&#8217;t have much energy.  My body just feels better at a higher weight.  Weight is simply a taboo topic and when you are a person that has studied the number on the scale critically and wondered why you can&#8217;t seem to keep your weight lower like all the girls at school do.  It means that you aren&#8217;t thinking about your body, your gentics, your shape.  My genetics, my shape is not conducive to weight 120 or less, just isn&#8217;t and I&#8217;m ok with it.</p>




<p>Now if I could get everyone else on board or to just leave the weight topic alone for bit life would be good.  Because some days I don&#8217;t want to have a debate on my weight, it&#8217;s my booty and I love it.  You don&#8217;t?  Then don&#8217;t look at it. :-P</p>

<h2>date: 2010-04-08 00:00:00 -0700</h2>

<p>Time for a quick update on the Cadillac.  Last time you read about the caddy, I shared my <a href="/2010/03/11/i-dub-thee-bionic-caddy/">discovery</a> that it had the rather desirable &#8220;Switch Pitch&#8221; variation of the Turbo 400 transmission.  As such, I decided it was best to have it examined before I put the car back together.  I took it over to Alphonso&#8217;s Transmission in Goleta, hoping that it just needed to be cleaned up, and perhaps have a few smaller parts repaired or replaced.  Unfortunately, this was not to be.  As he started dismantling the transmission he very quickly discovered that the main forward band was broken, the forward drum was burnt, and the 2/3 clutch pack was nearly worn down to the steel.  So, the only real choice at that point was to go ahead and rebuild the transmission completely.</p>




<p>Now, I&#8217;m totally stoked that the trans was rebuilt, and Alphonso has been building these things for longer than I&#8217;ve been alive, and did a spectacular job.  I also have a brand new variable pitch torque converter.  All for the (quite reasonable) price of $1100.  Problem is, I only had $600 to spend, which I was hoping would be enough to get the trans repaired, and buy a few small parts I needed to get the car back together.  Instead, I had to borrow the rest of the money from our savings.  This means for the next 3 months I&#8217;ll be paying our savings back from the caddy&#8217;s fund, at which point we&#8217;re expecting our new son Tate!  So as you can imagine I&#8217;m not going to have the time, nor the presence of mind to be working on the caddy for a while after that, and I won&#8217;t have any money to spend on it until then.</p>




<p>As a result, I&#8217;m trying to do little things on the caddy until Tate is born that don&#8217;t cost me anything.  So I&#8217;m tearing the motor down a bit further, and trying to clean it up.  I popped the timing cover off to check the timing chain/gears.  Turns out this is yet another part which is going to need replaced!  The chain is SUPER loose, like enough that I almost feel like I could cause it to skip a tooth with the slack.  Also, apparently in the late 60&#8217;s it was all the rage to install and market &#8220;silent&#8221; timing gears.  I had the same get-up on my 1967 Ford Thunderbird.  It&#8217;s essentially a hard plastic cam gear for the timing set, which is supposed to reduce the normal timing set noise.  I seriously don&#8217;t get this, since the other noises that these machines make more than drown out any noise that the timing set might make.  But, I digress..  The point is that the hard plastic cam gear is also showing signs of stress, with hairline cracks forming down the middle of each tooth.  It&#8217;ll definitely have to be replaced.</p>




<p>I had hoped that I could just throw the engine back together without buying a whole lot more parts for it, and as such had sorta planned not to inspect it too thoroughly.  With events unfolding as they have, I think I am going to go ahead and check all the rest of the clearances and see what else (if anything) may need replaced.  Depending on how things turn out, I may or may not stick with this motor.  As I&#8217;ve stated before, the 429 is a low production motor and the parts are surprisingly hard to find, as well as expensive.  If I find that it needs more than bearings (a cam, or some machine work for instance) I may simply sell this motor to someone who&#8217;s working on a numbers matching restoration and buy a 472/500 to put in it&#8217;s place.  The good news is that my 429 is in generally good shape, and certainly does not need a lot of work, so it should have some reasonable value to someone who&#8217;s looking for original parts.</p>




<p>So that&#8217;s where we stand.  I had hoped to have her all back together and be driving &#8216;er by now, but it looks like I&#8217;m going to be taking my time even a bit more, and being even a bit more methodical.  I can&#8217;t wait to experience that finely crafted and tuned transmission! ;-)</p>

<h2>date: 2010-03-31 00:00:00 -0700</h2>

<p>Things have been busy, and I haven&#8217;t had the time to devote to writing updates on either the Caddy, or my work in Grails.  But enough complaining, to pass the time until I can get some more quality content here, I wanted to share this little gem that took me entirely too long to figure out.</p>




<p>I wanted to be able to deploy my grails applications to a sub context, or sub directory of the root of my site.  This way I could leave my blog at the root of my domain, and categorize my grails apps a bit.  Take the following example.  Suppose I wanted to deploy a bunch of example grails apps in a subdirectory named &#8220;examples&#8221; off of the root of my web host.  Something like http://&lt;yourserver&gt;/examples/&lt;your-app-name&gt;.  This is how I was able to finally accomplish it.</p>




<h2>Deploy to a Tomcat Sub-Context</h2>


<p>If you&#8217;re a Tomcat guru this is all going to seem elementary, and it is, but it was superbly difficult for me to mine the information I needed from the web, so I&#8217;m sharing what I&#8217;ve learned here.  If, on the other hand, you&#8217;re a Tomcat newbie like me, you hopefully have a running instance of the Tomcat service.  If you don&#8217;t there are a number of great tutorials, including the official <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/appdev/installation.html">installation guide</a>.</p>




<p>Most of the stuff that you&#8217;ll read out there says that to deploy your grails app, you just upload your *.war file to the Tomcat &#8220;webapps&#8221; directory and you&#8217;re in business.  This is true, but of course when you do this, you just end up with a URL that looks like http://&lt;yourserver&gt;:8080/&lt;your-app-name&gt;.  Now, this is fine if you only intend to deploy a few apps and you dont mind that application being at the root for your domain/server name.  But we&#8217;re trying to put our apps in a sub directory of our site, off of the root.</p>




<p>My first instinct to accomplish this was to use some of the properties of the grails app itself, and I found many examples which recommended this.  So, I happily set my app.context in application.properties to the path I wanted.</p>




<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>application.properties (snippet) </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='groovy'><span class='line'> <span class="n">app</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">context</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">/examples/</span><span class="n">MyExampleApp</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>This works great when I do a grails run-app, I get the app deployed to http://localhost:8080/examples/MyExampleApp just like I wanted.  But, when I create a war and toss it in my Tomcat webapps directory, I still get the same old behavior of the application being deployed to the root of Tomcat with the same name as the war file.  So how the heck do I deploy my war into a sub directory of my Tomcat site?!</p>




<p>The secret lies in not simply dumping your war file into an existing &#8220;context&#8221; for Tomcat, but instead creating your own, and pointing that context to your war file. The first step toward this is to prepare a place for our webapp directories, outside of the Tomcat root webapp directory.  I choose /srv/tomcat-webapps but you&#8217;re obviously welcome to put this anywhere you like.  So let&#8217;s create the directory where we&#8217;re going to deploy our first example app.</p>




<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>mkdir -p /srv/tomcat-webapps/examples/MyExampleApp</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>Now, we need to find the Catalina configuration directory for our Tomcat deployment.  On Ubuntu, which is the environment I&#8217;m using, this is at /etc/tomcat6/Catalina/localhost.  What you&#8217;ll find there, are a number of XML files each one describes a &#8220;context&#8221;.  You can define sub-contexts by using a special syntax in the filename which is just barely mentioned in passing in the <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/config/context.html#Introduction">Tomcat docs</a>.  You can set a multi level context name by using the # character.  So lets create a new sub-context for our example app at the correct path.</p>




<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>#!/bin/sh mark:2 </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nb">cd</span> /etc/tomcat6/Catalina/localhost
</span><span class='line'>vim examples#MyExampleApp.xml
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>Now we need to add the content to this context file which will tell Tomcat where to find the applications files. Remember back when we created a new directory for our tomcat webapps, this is where we&#8217;ll use it.</p>




<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>examples#MyExampleApp.xml </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='xml'><span class='line'><span class="cp">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;context</span> <span class="na">antiresourcelocking=</span><span class="s">&quot;false&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="na">docbase=</span><span class="s">&quot;/srv/tomcat-webapps/examples/MyExampleApp&quot;</span> <span class="na">path=</span><span class="s">&quot;/examples/MyExampleApp&quot;</span> <span class="na">privileged=</span><span class="s">&quot;true&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>Now if you restart Tomcat, and unzip your war file to /srv/tomcat-webapps/examples/MyExampleApp you should be able to navigate to http://&lt;yourserver&gt;:8080/examples/MyExampleApp and see your application!</p>

<h2>date: 2010-03-18 00:00:00 -0700</h2>

<p>I just took delivery of my latest new computer from my employer. &nbsp;This time, instead of another run of the mill IBM compatible laptop or desktop it was a fancy new 17&quot; MacBook Pro. &nbsp;We&#39;re developing software which we&#39;re supporting in Safari using the Silverlight plugin and I needed to be able to develop and test in that native environment.</p>


<p>First, let me give you some background. &nbsp;See, I&#39;m an Apple geek from days of yore. &nbsp;We&#39;re talking Mac II and Quadra days here. &nbsp;I was raised around Apples because my father owned his own business in the desktop publishing industry. &nbsp;Around 1996 or so, I started to defect to &quot;the dark side&quot; and use the Windows OS, and only a few short years later I started dabbling with Linux, which is my current OS of choice.</p>


<p>Now, I knew that OSX was BSD based, and I knew I&#39;d like it. &nbsp;I also knew that the Apple hardware was pretty stinkin&#39; elegant. &nbsp;But man&#8230;. I had no idea. &nbsp;This feels all so new and exciting, but at the same time comfortable and familiar. &nbsp;In the ~3hrs I&#39;ve had it I&#39;ve installed pretty much an entire Groovy/Grails development tool set as well as installing and configuring things I&#39;ll be using on a daily basis.</p>


<p>I&#39;m discovering some things which require are requiring a bit of research, but once I find the answer it usually fits some pattern or concept that is very familiar. &nbsp;I&#39;ll likely be blogging about a few of those items as I continue to &quot;move in&quot; to my new machine.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve provided an update about the progress of on the Caddy. &nbsp;Mostly because things have been slow due to a busy work and family schedule. &nbsp;Here&#39;s the rundown of what I have gotten done though.</p>


<p>I have rebuilt the carb, and realized that a broken vacuum pot on the carb was actually only used to crack the throttle open a bit and increase the idle RPM when the A/C was running. &nbsp;Since the A/C system is not holding pressure, and looks like it hasn&#39;t in many many years, I went ahead and removed this &quot;extra&quot; part. &nbsp;Hopefully this&#39;ll fix the hesitation problem that I detected on the few short drives I took. &nbsp;</p>

<p>This is the second installment of my <a href="/2010/02/05/what-grooves-you/">What Grooves You?</a> series of posts, this time discussing how to modularize your Grails application.  While Grails does an awesome job of enforcing <a href="http://www.grails.org/Developer+-+Spring+MVC+Integration">MVC</a> once your application reaches a certain size, or you have multiple applications which may have shared components, you&#8217;re going to have to start thinking about how your going to modularize the reusable parts of your code.</p>

<h2>date: 2010-02-27 00:00:00 -0700</h2>

<p>I have been having a whole lot of epiphanies of late.  Be it about the new chores I have to take care of, I&rsquo;m still figuring all that out but to be honest I am really getting the hang of them.  I am still learning to change with Q&rsquo;s wants and needs.  I&rsquo;m sure all these years of learning and growing with the hubs has helped me a great deal.  I&rsquo;m still trying to figure out life and the meaning of it for me and my role as mother, wife, friend, sister, daughter and grand daughter.  I&rsquo;m thinking that I may have to continue to experiment.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m starting to realize all over again that I know nothing at all.  I keep learning more and more and feeling like maybe I have a handle on life and then again I find myself surprised and feeling clueless all over again.</p>

<p>What brought all this on?  I&rsquo;m at a new cross roads.  In the not too distant future we will be welcoming a new family member to our home and I&rsquo;m still trying to figure out just how we will approach this change.  The first question everyone has is how am I going to go about my recover from delivery.  I am sure that this time I will do all I can not to try to jump back into full swing of things until a couple weeks postpartum.  I&rsquo;m simply determined to focus on my new beautiful addition and my beautiful big boy and my incredible husband.</p>

<p>The other question that keeps coming up is will I be working after having our newest bundle of joy and I have yet to figure out the answer to that one.  The hubs has made his decision and though I think it is sweet I&rsquo;m not sure if that works best for our family.  We shall see.</p>

<p>I guess it all goes back to the entire stay at home mom vs. the working mom debate.  I love contributing financially to my family.  I love my job.  Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, my job is tough, even stressful but I do get something out of my job that is really satisfying.  On the other hand, the idea of staying home with my babies, keeping a home and leaving the money making to the hubs is exciting.  There is so much I fee like I am missing from the day to day with my toddler.  I can only imagine what I would miss from his relationship with his newest sibling.  I enjoyed my 10 weeks home with Q and I am excited about having at least as much time with our newest baby.  I&rsquo;m already dreading leaving my boys for work.  But there is still the question if I will be as good of a mom without work.  I am able to drop everything quickly to play with or cuddle my son.  Will I be so quick to do that without my working?  Do I get some kind of down time or selfish time when at work when all I have to think about is work and the goal directly in front of me?</p>

<p>The epiphany here is that maybe just maybe things in this aspect of life aren&rsquo;t so straight forward.  If you asked me five years ago I would have told you that I had every intention of being a stay at home mom from the moment I found out that I was pregnant.  That I just couldn&rsquo;t ever imagine working once I had my first child.  Now, shockingly, I have no idea what the plan is while I am expecting my second child.  I just want what is best for my family and I am still trying to figure out just what that means to our family.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still trying to figure out what is best for me.  With my myriad of health problems I know that pushing too hard is a huge detriment to myself.  I&rsquo;m starting to really take the time to stop and rest.  I&rsquo;m figuring out what my body needs and how to meet those needs.  I&rsquo;m learning to put myself as a priority, which is incredibly hard as a mother.</p>

<p>The big epiphany is there is just so much to figure out and that I may NEVER figure it all out and that is ok.  That is half the fun of this ride we call life.  Don&rsquo;t worry, in time you will hear me spout lots of stories about my boobies again.  What did you think I would post without mentioning my boobs?  LOL!  Yeah, no, not going to happen, after all I&rsquo;m a mom. :-P</p>

<p>This is my first installment in the <a href="/2010/02/05/what-grooves-you/">What Grooves You?</a> series of posts, and it deals with the first thing you&#8217;re going to need to consider if you are deploying your Grails/Groovy applications in the average corporate IT infrastructure, Single Sign On with Active Directory and NTLM.  Like it or not, because all of our existing applications are based on Microsoft technologies our users have gotten used to just going to the URL for the application they intend to use and being instantly recognized and authenticated.  Forcing them to sign in again, or worse still forcing them to setup a new username and password for your system would be completely unacceptable!  Below, I&#8217;ll take you through the steps I took to solve this problem, including the detours that cost me time!</p>

<p>In my &quot;Day Job&quot;, we design and build our applications using Microsoft technologies.  In particular, we&#8217;re using C#, Silverlight, and IIS to build and deploy our web applications.  This makes good sense because the vendors we use are well versed in the Microsoft technology, and like the IT infrastructure of a lot of medium and large companies Microsoft solutions are at the forefront.  It&#8217;s becoming apparent though that we&#8217;re going to have to consider our options and possibly embrace a different technology stack to properly scale and support the applications we&#8217;re building.</p>




<p>While I knew that Java servlets and the Spring Framework were the answers, credit goes to my boss <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile?viewProfile=&key=11181889">Scott Ellis</a> for really doing a deep dive into what technologies are on offer, and coming up with using Grails and Groovy as the best solution for us.  Which brings me to the reason for this blog post.  I&#8217;ve been spending some time playing around with Grails and Groovy, and familiarizing myself with the technology and what is on offer.  I intend to do a series of posts here about my discovery process, what problems I encounter, and how I resolve them.</p>




<p>From the searching I&#8217;ve had to do in order to get answers or better understanding about the challenges I&#8217;ve faced, I think I have a chance to be a real resource to others who are just starting out with Grails and Groovy.  What&#8217;s more I&#8217;m writing from the perspective of a relative newbie to the Java world.  Stay tuned as you follow my journey into Grails and Groovy. <em><strong>*Spoiler alert* - I like it, a LOT!</strong></em></p>
