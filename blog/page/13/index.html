  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I performed my search for the perfect <a href="/2008/09/25/photo-sharing-services/">photo sharing</a> solution, I fell in love with the Picasa desktop application.  I even discovered that there is a linux version.  However, as you&rsquo;d likely expect, it didn&rsquo;t really play nice as far as uploading photos to any photo sharing site other than Google&rsquo;s Picasa Web Albums.</p>

<p>On windows, there is a great solution called <a href="http://jerryong.com/blog/2008/06/picasa2flickr-uploads-your-picasa-photos-directly-to-flickr/">picasa2flickr</a> which passes the desired photo&rsquo;s to the windows <a href="http://www.flickr.com/tools/uploadr/">Flickr Uploader</a>.  Again, for obvious reasons, this doesn&rsquo;t work well on linux.</p>

<p>So, having determined that it wasn&rsquo;t worth my time to pursue trying to get Flickr uploads working from Picasa on Linux, I started evaluating many of the other native options on linux, such as digikam and fspot.  While these more easily uploaded to Flickr, and had open API&rsquo;s, none of them worked quite the way I wanted, so I abandoned my search for a good solution.</p>

<p>Then, on a whim I did a Google search just a couple hours after Andy O&#8217;Neill made a <a href="http://ultrahigh.org/2008/12/09/picflick-picasa-to-flickr-export-on-linux/">blog post</a> about a button he wrote to import photos to Flickr from the Linux version of Picasa, named picflick.</p>

<p>I eagerly (re)installed Picasa3 on my Gentoo box using a beta ebuild found <a href="http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=240406">here</a>.  Then installed his button.</p>

<p>After playing with it for a bit, I realized a few things didn&rsquo;t quite jive for me.</p>

<p>1) The script automatically resizes the image before uploading it to Flickr.  I prefer to upload all of my images at their original resolution, so this was a bit of a road block for me.</p>

<p>2) The script used a Perl module to upload to Flickr.  For the life of me, I couldn&rsquo;t seem to figure out how to get it authorized with my Flickr account to actually permit uploads.  I&rsquo;m sure if I spent a bit more time and read a few more manuals I could have gotten it right, but it didn&rsquo;t quite work &ldquo;out-of-the-box&rdquo; for me.</p>

<p>3) I&rsquo;d prefer to see the progress being made, rather than the beeps and tray notifications that Andy&rsquo;s script provided.</p>

<p>So, I stole the key part of his script, the part which translates Windows paths to *nix ones, and broke down the rest to simply pass the photos on to my preferred linux Flickr uploader, <a href="http://kflickr.sourceforge.net/wikka.php?wakka=Kflickr">KFlickr</a></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the contents of my script, including the win2native function written by Andy.</p>

<pre lang="bash" line="1">
#!/bin/bash

DEBUG=1     # debug to $LOG
LOG=/tmp/picflick.log
PICASA_WINE_DIR="$HOME/.google\/picasa\/3.0\/drive_c"  # Relative to $HOME
PICASA_WINE_DIR_NATIVE=`echo $PICASA_WINE_DIR |sed 's|\\\\||g'`

function debug() {
        if [ $DEBUG -eq 1 ]; then
                echo "$*" >> $LOG
        fi
}

# wine2native(): convert wine filename to native linux filenames
# Arguments: _name_ of variable which holds path
# Example: wine2native file  # not wine2native $file
function wine2native() {
        VAR=$1
        eval "VAL=\$$1"
        debug "Wine path: $VAL"
        # use '|' to delimit the paths
        VAL=`echo "$VAL" | \
                sed "s|C:|$PICASA_WINE_DIR|" | \
                sed 's|\\\\|/|g'`
        debug "Source file: $VAL"
        eval "$VAR=\$VAL"
}

# check we have the required dependencies
which kflickr > /dev/null || die "You need to install kflickr"

file=$1
wine2native file
DIR=`dirname "$file"`
EXT=${file##*.}
debug "START_UPLOAD"
for file in "$@"; do
        wine2native file
        KFLICKR="$KFLICKR $file"
done

debug "Launching kflickr with the following args $KFLICKR"
kflickr $KFLICKR

debug "Done"
</pre>


<p>Now when I click the &ldquo;Flickr&rdquo; button in Picasa, it brings up the KFlickr app with all the pictures I selected ready to upload.  Thanks for the inspiration, and code bits to make this work Andy, I was too lazy to actually figure out what was necessary to pull the image paths from Picasa and use them.</p>

<p>What you&rsquo;ve just seen is the latest marketing campaign by Burger King.  Every time I see teasers for this on TV, I feel&hellip;  I dunno..  Just&hellip;  Wrong.</p>

<p>Something about this offends me, and I&rsquo;m not really sure what it is yet.  There are <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/3546969/Burger-King-under-fire-for-Whopper-Virgins-taste-test-challenge.html">others</a> who feel very strongly about it.  I&rsquo;m not sure I agree with any one of those opinions directly.  But something about this just doesn&rsquo;t set right with me.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d wager that if Burger King were doing this as a purely altruistic endeavor, by providing food to remote villages without the marketing spin people might feel differently, myself in included.  However, as it stands, it feels awfully exploitative for the sake of marketing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Okay, if you thought the idea of a lightweight <a href="/2008/11/03/45l-duramax-saturn-sky/">sports car</a> with a big diesel v8 was exciting, consider this.</p>

<p>There is a kit car company out there named <a href="http://www.factoryfive.com/index.html">Factory Five</a> that makes various kit cars.  Cobra replicas, hot rods, and perhaps most interestingly, a &ldquo;build it yourself&rdquo; <a href="http://www.factoryfive.com/gtmhome.html">super car</a>.</p>

<p>Now the GTM super car kit is designed to be built mostly from 5th generation corvette parts, including the LS1 motor that&rsquo;s usually under the hood.  Now, we&rsquo;ve already established that the 4.5L duramax due in 2010 is designed to fit in the same envelop as the average LS series gas motor, and for the time being, I&rsquo;m going to stick to my assertion that the bellhousing bolt pattern will remain the same.  If all that turns out to be reality, this vehicle is practically designed to take the 4.5L duramax!  Sure, some intake and exhaust work will be necessary to point stuff out the other direction, however the &ldquo;inverse&rdquo; design of the intake an exhaust (exhaust ports and turbo live in the &ldquo;V&rdquo; of the motor, and intake is on the outside of the heads) might make this modification fairly easy.</p>

<p>Even at ~340hp, this thing should do 0-60 in around 3.5 seconds and put down a very low 11 second &frac14; mile!  The best part is, where my proposed Saturn Sky would be near the limits of traction and structural rigidity, this vehicle is DESIGNED for big power and huge stresses.  When the aftermarket catches up with the 4.5L, imagine how this thing would perform with over 500hp and 800-900ft/lbs torque!</p>

<p>Including the kit, the required C5 parts, and acquiring the new 4.5L duramax I imagine you could build one of these for under $70k.  Just imagine!  You&rsquo;d have something that out runs and out guns just about any super car ever built, and still knock down huge MPG numbers when you stay out of the loud pedal.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to start saving my pennies now.  ;&ndash;)</p>

Just became aware of the Tea Fire after driving home.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re actually further away from this fire than we were from the Gap Fire, but this one &ldquo;feels&rdquo; closer because it&rsquo;s much more clearly visible from our home.  The above image is from just outside our back door of our apartment.</p>

<p>So far the air quality is quite bearable, though we&rsquo;re having to keep the doors and windows closed to keep my wife&rsquo;s asthma from flaring up.</p>

<p>You can see all my pictures, right from behind our apartment on my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rgeyer/sets/72157609035026410/">Flickr stream</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So we just recently got a new sectional.  In order to make space for it, we put our old recliner sofa in the back of my truck, and hauled it away.  Of course, this meant I had to remove my car pc from the back of my explorer.  Unfortunately, I didn&rsquo;t tidy up the loose cables that were left behind before we put the couch in.</p>

<p>The result?  I bent a bunch of the pins on my VGA connector on the cable to my 8&#8221; Lilliput touch screen.  I tried bending them back, but they simply broke.  So the only solution is to put a new connector on.</p>

<p>Now the Lilliput proprietary cable carries the VGA signal and the USB signal for the touchscreen.  In total there are 9 wires.  Of course, I had to figure out the pinout in order to connect everything back up.</p>

<p>Using a multimeter and some trial and error I figured it out for my cable.  It might fit be the same for others, it might not but this info might be useful for somebody.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since the first time I saw the Saturn Sky Roadster I fell in love with it.  Though, with my particular passion for diesel I&rsquo;d love to see one with a diesel motor.</p>

<p>Well, in 2010 GM is planning to release a <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2007/06/15/gm-announces-clean-diesel-v8-for-pickups-and-the-hummer-h2/">4.5L V8 Duramax.</a>  All of the marketing materials and announcements say that it&rsquo;s being designed to fit into the space of an LS small block, so pretty much anywhere a current GM v8 fits, this thing will too.  And it&rsquo;s currently being estimated at ~345hp!</p>

<p>This is good news, cause there are already several folks who have swapped LS1s and LS7s into Sky&rsquo;s and Solstices, and even some people making <a href="http://www.mallettcars.com/sky-conversion.htm">aftermarket kits</a>.</p>

<p>Now no one has said anything about if the 4.5 Duramax will have the same bolt pattern for the bellhousing as an LS, but it&rsquo;s probably a safe bet that it will.</p>

<p>A sky equipped this way should be able to out perform all but the most elite Corvette, and knock down 35+ MPG on the highway.  Yum!</p>

<p>Now, this isn&rsquo;t quite bleeding edge stuff but it certainly brings me up to date and I&rsquo;m quite happy.  Because I wanted just a ROCK SOLID setup and wasn&rsquo;t intending to overclock, I went with an Intel motherboard.  I didn&rsquo;t want to regret not getting enough memory, so I maxxed it out with 8GB.  I don&rsquo;t really game so the video card is nothing special, but I did want enough horsepower to drive my big monitor and take advantage of Vista&rsquo;s Aero theme and some of the cool linux eye candy that&rsquo;s in KDE4 etc.  I am NOT disappointed!</p>

<p>So far I&rsquo;ve gotten Gentoo linux installed on the system.  The speed of compiling is admirable though not mind blowing.  One of the first things I installed though was <a href="http://cinelerra.org/">Cinelerra</a> and I loaded up some of my HDV source material.  While I should have expected as much I was able to play, edit, and render the HD in realtime!  WOO HOO!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m quite impressed with Gentoo, no hardware headaches, everything more-or-less worked out of the box.  I haven&rsquo;t quite got all my favorite apps installed and running but I trust it will be uneventful.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m in the process of moving my drives/data over from my old system.  I had a software RAID1 setup using mdadm which I&rsquo;ve been able to bring back up on the new box.  Going to play with a RAID5 since I now have enough disks, and maybe simulate a failure to test recovery.  This should get my confidence up for building a linux software based RAID5 NAS box which is the next project.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I tend to have lots of ideas about project cars that I think are pretty cool.  The chances are I won&rsquo;t ever build any of them, but I figured I could start documenting them here just for fun, or on the odd chance that somebody reads my ideas and decides to build one of them.</p>

<p>So, for my first submission..</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been interested in the early to mid 70&rsquo;s datsun z for some time.  I even bought the &ldquo;jags-that-run&rdquo; book on converting one to a chevy 350 drivetrain.  I&rsquo;m still very interested owning one of these cars and doing an engine swap.  Here&rsquo;s what I think would be cool.</p>

<p>Take a 3.0L diesel, the modern common rail motor that is also dubbed &ldquo;Blutec&rdquo; when all of the emissions magic is done on it, out of a wrecked Mercedes and stuff it into a 240z.  Yeah, there are bigger badder diesel motors but they are heavier and would extend past the front axle of the z.  I&rsquo;m looking for a small, fast, but most importantly agile car.</p>

<p>Of course, the ideal transmission for this would be a true 6 speed manual, but no production vehicle with the 3.0L has one so getting the computer to cooperate, and mating up a manual may be more trouble than it&rsquo;s worth.  However, if you carried over the 7 speed automatic from the Benz and fashioned a paddle type shifter to activate the up and down shifts (should be possible since there is an &ldquo;automanual&rdquo; setting for the Benz that&rsquo;s clearly electronically triggered) it should still be a heck of a lotta fun in the twisties.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since I became a dad, and bought a dSLR I&rsquo;ve been trying to figure out the best way to store and share my pictures of my son, and other interesting stuff I shoot.  As far as securely storing it locally, I have a sizable RAID setup that handles redundantly storing my pictures on two drives, but it&rsquo;s the sharing part that I&rsquo;ve had some trouble with.</p>

<p>Initially, I was using my own web host and the rather nice PHP based <a href="http://spgm.sourceforge.net/">SPGM photo gallery</a> software.  The problem though, is that it&rsquo;s fairly tedious to resize and upload the images (I wrote a whole blog post about it <a href="/2008/03/06/tools-for-updating-an-online-image-gallery/">here</a>), and I have &ldquo;only&rdquo; 20GB of storage and 500GB monthly throughput.  When shooting at 10 megapixels I could fill that space up quickly.  Beyond that I knew that some of the web based sharing sites out there had some really cool features for sharing and organizing your photos.</p>

<p>So, the search begins.  I had some (I thought) fairly simple requirements.  I was hoping to have these requirements met by a free solution, but I was willing to pay a nominal subscription fee if I got everything I was after.  Here&rsquo;s the run-down of what was important to me.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Ability to upload original sized images.  Some services have a limit to the size of each image</li>
        <li>Unlimited storage/uploads</li>
    <li>Sophisticated organization features.  This means unlimited &#8220;albums&#8221; and the ability to have an &#8220;album&#8221; hierarchy and probably some other stuff that the service would surprise me with</li>
    <li>Ability to use my images on my website, blog, forum posts, etc.</li>
    <li>Ability to have a gallery on my site which displays all of the public images from the photo sharing site</li>
</ul>


<p>That&rsquo;s a fairly short list, and seems as though it should be fairly easy to match but surprisingly it isn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s break down the services I tried and how they stack up.  First, let me say that I did not try every service out there, I ruled some out just based on their feature set, some due to their obscurity etc.  Listed here are just the ones that I either discovered myself, or were directly suggested to me.  If you want to do your own search and want to see all of the services available, here are a couple links that I found useful during my search.</p>

<p><a href="http://photo-sharing-services-review.toptenreviews.com/">Top Ten Reviews</a>
<a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-6451_7-6245099-1.html">CNET Reviews</a></p>

<h3>Picasa</h3>


<p>This was a fairly natural choice for me since I&rsquo;m a pretty heavy user of Google services.  I use Gmail, Google Reader, Google Analytics, Google Calendar, Blogger (switched from blogger to wordpress), Google Docs, and YouTube.  Additionally, Picasa has a great desktop tool for uploading photos that acts as a great photo management tool on your local system as well.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Picasa only allows you to organize your photos into albums with no hierarchy.  Also, while you can upload a photo in it&rsquo;s original size, the number of photos you can store is limited by your storage space.  You&rsquo;re given 1GB of space for free, and you can buy additional space on a yearly basis.  But again, shooting at 10 megapixels means I&rsquo;m going to need a whole lot of storage space, and I suspect that even their 400GB plan for $500 a year would become insufficient sooner or later.</p>

<h3>Facebook</h3>


<p>To be honest, Facebook is actually what warmed me up to the idea of using a photo sharing service on the web.  So while it&rsquo;s technically not a photo sharing service I thought I&rsquo;d talk about what I did and didn&rsquo;t like about the photo storage and sharing options it had.</p>

<p>First, I loved how easy it was to upload pictures and tag the subjects in the photo.  Facebook also had no limit to the number of photos I could upload.  Of course, those photos were downsized to a much more reasonable 604x404px, and their album hierarchy was also flat.  And perhaps the most annoying thing was that I couldn&rsquo;t share my pictures on my own web site and the galleries I made public I had to link directly.  For instance I can send you to my public album of <a href="http://www.new.facebook.com/album.php?aid=3616&l=53ace&id=1344570211">artistic shots</a> but I can&rsquo;t send you to a page that shows all of my public albums on Facebook.  If you had a Facebook account, and were added as one of my friends you could see them all, but that&rsquo;s cumbersome.</p>

<h3>Snapfish</h3>


<p>Frankly, I didn&rsquo;t get very far in evaluating this service.  There wasn&rsquo;t much public information about the services offered, and it had a requirement of buying some product from them at some specified interval in order to keep your account active.  As such, I never even signed up or tried it.</p>

<h2>And the winner is&#8230;.</h2>




<h3>Flickr</h3>


<p>As it turns out, this had all of the features I wanted, plus some ones I didn&rsquo;t realize I wanted until I used them.</p>

<p>First, the negatives.  With a free account your only allowed to upload 100MB of files each month, and you&rsquo;re limited to 3 &ldquo;sets&rdquo; (Flickr&rsquo;s version of an album).  Also, you can&rsquo;t technically have a multi-level hierarchy of sets but there are ways to overcome that (more on this later).  Of course, those limitations are removed as soon as you buy a &ldquo;Pro&rdquo; account which is a paltry $25 per year.  Needless to say I went with that.</p>

<p>Now the good stuff!  While you can only have a flat hierarchy of sets, you can create &ldquo;collections&rdquo; which contain sets or other collections.  These can be nested up to 5 deep.  This more than handles my organization needs.  For instance, I&rsquo;d like to categorize all of my pictures of my son, then break it down into particular types of events, then the specific event.  Something like &ldquo;Baby Pictures &ndash;> Firsts &ndash;> Crawling, Walking, Solid Food, Etc.&rdquo;.</p>

<p>And if that organization is not enough, you can also tag a photo with keywords that are search able by the community, and act as a sort of metadata for organization.</p>

<p>Built right in is the ability to use your photo in a variety of sizes on your blog, forums, website, or whatever you like.  Even more exciting is that there are plenty of options for sharing your pictures on other sites, as well as a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rgeyer/">public landing page</a> for you.  They even offer an open API which I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll find useful eventually!</p>

<p>So there it is.  After a fair amount of time spent searching I found the solution that works best for me.  Hopefully my comparison can help you if you&rsquo;re searching for a photo sharing service.</p>
