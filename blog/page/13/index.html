  <div class="entry-content">Okay, if you thought the idea of a lightweight <a href="http://www.nslms.com/2008/11/03/45l-duramax-saturn-sky/">sports car</a> with a big diesel v8 was exciting, consider this.

There is a kit car company out there named <a href="http://www.factoryfive.com/index.html">Factory Five</a> that makes various kit cars.  Cobra replicas, hot rods, and perhaps most interestingly, a &#8220;build it yourself&#8221; <a href="http://www.factoryfive.com/gtmhome.html">super car</a>.

Now the GTM super car kit is designed to be built mostly from 5th generation corvette parts, including the LS1 motor that&#8217;s usually under the hood.  Now, we&#8217;ve already established that the 4.5L duramax due in 2010 is designed to fit in the same envelop as the average LS series gas motor, and for the time being, I&#8217;m going to stick to my assertion that the bellhousing bolt pattern will remain the same.  If all that turns out to be reality, this vehicle is practically designed to take the 4.5L duramax!  Sure, some intake and exhaust work will be necessary to point stuff out the other direction, however the &#8220;inverse&#8221; design of the intake an exhaust (exhaust ports and turbo live in the &#8220;V&#8221; of the motor, and intake is on the outside of the heads) might make this modification fairly easy.

Even at ~340hp, this thing should do 0-60 in around 3.5 seconds and put down a very low 11 second 1/4 mile!  The best part is, where my proposed Saturn Sky would be near the limits of traction and structural rigidity, this vehicle is DESIGNED for big power and huge stresses.  When the aftermarket catches up with the 4.5L, imagine how this thing would perform with over 500hp and 800-900ft/lbs torque!

Including the kit, the required C5 parts, and acquiring the new 4.5L duramax I imagine you could build one of these for under $70k.  Just imagine!  You&#8217;d have something that out runs and out guns just about any super car ever built, and still knock down huge MPG numbers when you stay out of the loud pedal.

I&#8217;m going to start saving my pennies now.  ;-)

Just became aware of the Tea Fire after driving home.

We&#8217;re actually further away from this fire than we were from the Gap Fire, but this one &#8220;feels&#8221; closer because it&#8217;s much more clearly visible from our home.  The above image is from just outside our back door of our apartment.

So far the air quality is quite bearable, though we&#8217;re having to keep the doors and windows closed to keep my wife&#8217;s asthma from flaring up.

You can see all my pictures, right from behind our apartment on my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rgeyer/sets/72157609035026410/">Flickr stream</a>

  <div class="entry-content">So we just recently got a new sectional.  In order to make space for it, we put our old recliner sofa in the back of my truck, and hauled it away.  Of course, this meant I had to remove my car pc from the back of my explorer.  Unfortunately, I didn&#8217;t tidy up the loose cables that were left behind before we put the couch in.

The result?  I bent a bunch of the pins on my VGA connector on the cable to my 8&#8221; Lilliput touch screen.  I tried bending them back, but they simply broke.  So the only solution is to put a new connector on.

Now the Lilliput proprietary cable carries the VGA signal and the USB signal for the touchscreen.  In total there are 9 wires.  Of course, I had to figure out the pinout in order to connect everything back up.

Using a multimeter and some trial and error I figured it out for my cable.  It might fit be the same for others, it might not but this info might be useful for somebody.

  <div class="entry-content">Since the first time I saw the Saturn Sky Roadster I fell in love with it.  Though, with my particular passion for diesel I&#8217;d love to see one with a diesel motor.

Well, in 2010 GM is planning to release a <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2007/06/15/gm-announces-clean-diesel-v8-for-pickups-and-the-hummer-h2/">4.5L V8 Duramax.</a>  All of the marketing materials and announcements say that it&#8217;s being designed to fit into the space of an LS small block, so pretty much anywhere a current GM v8 fits, this thing will too.  And it&#8217;s currently being estimated at ~345hp!

This is good news, cause there are already several folks who have swapped LS1s and LS7s into Sky&#8217;s and Solstices, and even some people making <a href="http://www.mallettcars.com/sky-conversion.htm">aftermarket kits</a>.

Now no one has said anything about if the 4.5 Duramax will have the same bolt pattern for the bellhousing as an LS, but it&#8217;s probably a safe bet that it will.

A sky equipped this way should be able to out perform all but the most elite Corvette, and knock down 35+ MPG on the highway.  Yum!

  <div class="entry-content">Time for the second installment of my worklog for my <a href="http://www.nslms.com/2008/09/05/the-upgrade-begins/">PC Upgrade</a>.

Well, I actually received all the bits from UPS Monday (is it Thursday already? sheesh).  I actually assembled the thing Monday afternoon/evening, and have been slowly installing software and getting it up to speed.

For the curious, and so I can brag a bit heres the parts list.
<ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817104954">FSP Group SAGA+ 450R 450W ATX12V Power Supply</a></li>

	<li><a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813121314">Intel BOXDP35DPM LGA 775 Intel P35 ATX Intel Motherboard - Retail</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819115017">Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600 Kentsfield 2.4GHz 2 x 4MB L2 Cache LGA 775 Quad-Core Processor</a></li>
	<li>4 x 2GB = 8GB<a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820134636"> Kingston 2GB 240-Pin DDR2 SDRAM DDR2 800 (PC2 6400)</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814130378">EVGA 512-P3-N954-TR GeForce 9500 GT 512MB</a></li>

</ul>

Now, this isn&#8217;t quite bleeding edge stuff but it certainly brings me up to date and I&#8217;m quite happy.  Because I wanted just a ROCK SOLID setup and wasn&#8217;t intending to overclock, I went with an Intel motherboard.  I didn&#8217;t want to regret not getting enough memory, so I maxxed it out with 8GB.  I don&#8217;t really game so the video card is nothing special, but I did want enough horsepower to drive my big monitor and take advantage of Vista&#8217;s Aero theme and some of the cool linux eye candy that&#8217;s in KDE4 etc.  I am NOT disappointed!

So far I&#8217;ve gotten Gentoo linux installed on the system.  The speed of compiling is admirable though not mind blowing.  One of the first things I installed though was <a href="http://cinelerra.org/">Cinelerra</a> and I loaded up some of my HDV source material.  While I should have expected as much I was able to play, edit, and render the HD in realtime!  WOO HOO!

I&#8217;m quite impressed with Gentoo, no hardware headaches, everything more-or-less worked out of the box.  I haven&#8217;t quite got all my favorite apps installed and running but I trust it will be uneventful.

I&#8217;m in the process of moving my drives/data over from my old system.  I had a software RAID1 setup using mdadm which I&#8217;ve been able to bring back up on the new box.  Going to play with a RAID5 since I now have enough disks, and maybe simulate a failure to test recovery.  This should get my confidence up for building a linux software based RAID5 NAS box which is the next project.

  <div class="entry-content">I tend to have lots of ideas about project cars that I think are pretty cool.  The chances are I won&#8217;t ever build any of them, but I figured I could start documenting them here just for fun, or on the odd chance that somebody reads my ideas and decides to build one of them.

So, for my first submission..

I&#8217;ve been interested in the early to mid 70&#8217;s datsun z for some time.  I even bought the &#8220;jags-that-run&#8221; book on converting one to a chevy 350 drivetrain.  I&#8217;m still very interested owning one of these cars and doing an engine swap.  Here&#8217;s what I think would be cool.

Take a 3.0L diesel, the modern common rail motor that is also dubbed &#8220;Blutec&#8221; when all of the emissions magic is done on it, out of a wrecked Mercedes and stuff it into a 240z.  Yeah, there are bigger badder diesel motors but they are heavier and would extend past the front axle of the z.  I&#8217;m looking for a small, fast, but most importantly agile car.

Of course, the ideal transmission for this would be a true 6 speed manual, but no production vehicle with the 3.0L has one so getting the computer to cooperate, and mating up a manual may be more trouble than it&#8217;s worth.  However, if you carried over the 7 speed automatic from the Benz and fashioned a paddle type shifter to activate the up and down shifts (should be possible since there is an &#8220;automanual&#8221; setting for the Benz that&#8217;s clearly electronically triggered) it should still be a heck of a lotta fun in the twisties.

  <div class="entry-content">Since I became a dad, and bought a dSLR I&#8217;ve been trying to figure out the best way to store and share my pictures of my son, and other interesting stuff I shoot.  As far as securely storing it locally, I have a sizable RAID setup that handles redundantly storing my pictures on two drives, but it&#8217;s the sharing part that I&#8217;ve had some trouble with.

Initially, I was using my own web host and the rather nice PHP based <a href="http://spgm.sourceforge.net/">SPGM photo gallery</a> software.  The problem though, is that it&#8217;s fairly tedious to resize and upload the images (I wrote a whole blog post about it <a href="http://www.nslms.com/2008/03/06/tools-for-updating-an-online-image-gallery/">here</a>), and I have &#8220;only&#8221; 20GB of storage and 500GB monthly throughput.  When shooting at 10 megapixels I could fill that space up quickly.  Beyond that I knew that some of the web based sharing sites out there had some really cool features for sharing and organizing your photos.

So, the search begins.  I had some (I thought) fairly simple requirements.  I was hoping to have these requirements met by a free solution, but I was willing to pay a nominal subscription fee if I got everything I was after.  Here&#8217;s the run-down of what was important to me.

<ul>
	<li>Ability to upload original sized images.  Some services have a limit to the size of each image</li>
        <li>Unlimited storage/uploads</li>
	<li>Sophisticated organization features.  This means unlimited &#8220;albums&#8221; and the ability to have an &#8220;album&#8221; hierarchy and probably some other stuff that the service would surprise me with</li>
	<li>Ability to use my images on my website, blog, forum posts, etc.</li>
	<li>Ability to have a gallery on my site which displays all of the public images from the photo sharing site</li>
</ul>

That&#8217;s a fairly short list, and seems as though it should be fairly easy to match but surprisingly it isn&#8217;t.

So let&#8217;s break down the services I tried and how they stack up.  First, let me say that I did not try every service out there, I ruled some out just based on their feature set, some due to their obscurity etc.  Listed here are just the ones that I either discovered myself, or were directly suggested to me.  If you want to do your own search and want to see all of the services available, here are a couple links that I found useful during my search.

<h3>Picasa</h3>
This was a fairly natural choice for me since I&#8217;m a pretty heavy user of Google services.  I use Gmail, Google Reader, Google Analytics, Google Calendar, Blogger (switched from blogger to wordpress), Google Docs, and YouTube.  Additionally, Picasa has a great desktop tool for uploading photos that acts as a great photo management tool on your local system as well.

Unfortunately, Picasa only allows you to organize your photos into albums with no hierarchy.  Also, while you can upload a photo in it&#8217;s original size, the number of photos you can store is limited by your storage space.  You&#8217;re given 1GB of space for free, and you can buy additional space on a yearly basis.  But again, shooting at 10 megapixels means I&#8217;m going to need a whole lot of storage space, and I suspect that even their 400GB plan for $500 a year would become insufficient sooner or later.

<h3>Facebook</h3>
To be honest, Facebook is actually what warmed me up to the idea of using a photo sharing service on the web.  So while it&#8217;s technically not a photo sharing service I thought I&#8217;d talk about what I did and didn&#8217;t like about the photo storage and sharing options it had.

First, I loved how easy it was to upload pictures and tag the subjects in the photo.  Facebook also had no limit to the number of photos I could upload.  Of course, those photos were downsized to a much more reasonable 604x404px, and their album hierarchy was also flat.  And perhaps the most annoying thing was that I couldn&#8217;t share my pictures on my own web site and the galleries I made public I had to link directly.  For instance I can send you to my public album of <a href="http://www.new.facebook.com/album.php?aid=3616&l=53ace&id=1344570211">artistic shots</a> but I can&#8217;t send you to a page that shows all of my public albums on Facebook.  If you had a Facebook account, and were added as one of my friends you could see them all, but that&#8217;s cumbersome.

<h3>Snapfish</h3>
Frankly, I didn&#8217;t get very far in evaluating this service.  There wasn&#8217;t much public information about the services offered, and it had a requirement of buying some product from them at some specified interval in order to keep your account active.  As such, I never even signed up or tried it.

<h2>And the winner is&#8230;.</h2>

<h3>Flickr</h3>
As it turns out, this had all of the features I wanted, plus some ones I didn&#8217;t realize I wanted until I used them.

First, the negatives.  With a free account your only allowed to upload 100MB of files each month, and you&#8217;re limited to 3 &#8220;sets&#8221; (Flickr&#8217;s version of an album).  Also, you can&#8217;t technically have a multi-level hierarchy of sets but there are ways to overcome that (more on this later).  Of course, those limitations are removed as soon as you buy a &#8220;Pro&#8221; account which is a paltry $25 per year.  Needless to say I went with that.

Now the good stuff!  While you can only have a flat hierarchy of sets, you can create &#8220;collections&#8221; which contain sets or other collections.  These can be nested up to 5 deep.  This more than handles my organization needs.  For instance, I&#8217;d like to categorize all of my pictures of my son, then break it down into particular types of events, then the specific event.  Something like &#8220;Baby Pictures -> Firsts -> Crawling, Walking, Solid Food, Etc.&#8221;.

And if that organization is not enough, you can also tag a photo with keywords that are search able by the community, and act as a sort of metadata for organization.

Built right in is the ability to use your photo in a variety of sizes on your blog, forums, website, or whatever you like.  Even more exciting is that there are plenty of options for sharing your pictures on other sites, as well as a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rgeyer/">public landing page</a> for you.  They even offer an open API which I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll find useful eventually!

So there it is.  After a fair amount of time spent searching I found the solution that works best for me.  Hopefully my comparison can help you if you&#8217;re searching for a photo sharing service.

  <div class="entry-content">Okay, so it&#8217;s not news that the new <a href="http://nikonusa.com/Find-Your-Nikon/Product/Digital-SLR/25446/D90.html">Nikon D90</a> digital SLR has been announced.

The camera is the following (new) features crammed into a body with the same footprint as the D80.
<ul>
  <li>12.3MP CMOS sensor</li>
  <li>3 inch screen with &#8220;Live View&#8221;</li>
  <li>Built in support for GPS geo-tagging in your EXIF data (GPS receiver sold seperately)</li>
  <li>D-Movie mode for up to 5 minutes of 720p video</li>
  <li>Probably some other stuff that escaped my notice or didn&#8217;t seem important to me</li>
</ul>

<h3>12.3MP CMOS sensor</h3>
No surprise here, it&#8217;s a higher MP sensor, and is a CMOS sensor rather than a CCD sensor.  To be honest, I&#8217;m not clear on the differences between the two, but CMOS sensors are what are in all the newer cameras, as well as my HDV camcorder.

<h3>3 inch screen with &#8220;Live View&#8221;</h3>
You simply can&#8217;t argue that a bigger screen is better, and the addition of &#8220;Live View&#8221; (basically the ability to use the screen as a viewfinder, like your point-and-shoot digicam) is pretty cool too.

<h3>Built in GPS geo-tagging support</h3>
Also pretty cool and allows you to show exactly where photos were taken, though there are ways to do this with some existing dSLR&#8217;s.  Doesn&#8217;t really do much for me since I&#8217;m rarely taking photos in any really exciting places.

<h3>D-Movie mode</h3>
Yup, you can record up to 5 minutes of 720p video with mono sound with the D90.  There is a lot of controversy about this ability, and many are calling it a gimmick.

Now, with all that said, I&#8217;m not ready to go out and trade my D80 in for one.  &#8220;But I thought you said you were excited.&#8221;, I can hear you saying..

Well, yes..  I&#8217;m very VERY intrigued by the D-Movie mode.  Now, as it&#8217;s implemented in the D90 I&#8217;d rather use my Sony HDR-HC1 camcorder to capture video to tape, but the idea of similar resolution captured through a nice Nikon VR lens with the ability to use nice depth of field tricks is very VERY exciting to me.  There have been people who&#8217;ve speculated that Nikon may make the transition into a full fledged video camera using the technology from this camera.  If they do, and they keep it affordable (say, under $2k), I&#8217;d be first in line for one!

Meanwhile, I&#8217;m looking into building an adapter that will allow me to attach my SLR lenses to my little camcorder to get depth of field (DOF), but I&#8217;d much prefer having something that does this sort of thing by design!

If you&#8217;re curious about the &#8220;DOF adapter&#8221;, I just recently discovered that such a thing existed from a <a href="http://strobist.blogspot.com/2008/08/labor-day-weekend-speedlinks.html">labor day post</a> over at <a href="http://www.strobist.blogspot.com/">Strobist</a>.

  <div class="entry-content"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3169/2846276120_2d543fceff.jpg" alt="Cool image captured with my free light box" />

Since acquiring my Nikon D80 Digital SLR, I&#8217;ve been spending more and more time reading and researching about how to best exploit it&#8217;s capabilities and improve my shooting skills.  As a result of this effort I&#8217;ve found a wonderful resource on lighting with small off camera flashes over at <a href="http://strobist.blogspot.com/">Strobist</a>.  I stumbled across them when I was searching for a cheap way to build my own &#8220;light box&#8221; for shooting small(ish) objects with great studio lighting.  That&#8217;s how I found <a href="http://strobist.blogspot.com/2006/07/how-to-diy-10-macro-photo-studio.html">this article on creating a $10 macro photo studio</a>.

Even as cheap as it was, I wasn&#8217;t sufficiently motivated to get the parts together to build it as it would require a couple trips to crafts stores etc.  Then it occurred to me, I already have most, if not all of the materials to build this just sitting around the apartment!

My base was a cardboard box originally used to carry two 2.5 gallon Arrowhead water bottles, it&#8217;s almost EXACTLY a 12&#8221; cube.  Then, lacking tissue paper, I needed some sort of diffuser.  I then realized I have plenty of white kitchen trash bags which are sufficiently translucent.  After hacking up the box, and putting in the plastic windows all I needed was a backdrop.  An old poster that had been rolled up and forgotten about in a closet for years was a perfect candidate after some cutting.  So here, in all it&#8217;s glory is my free light box!

<img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3219/2846276906_50e43c08a4.jpg" alt="My free light box" />

The poster I used for a backdrop was a teensy bit wrinkled, and was a bit more reflective than I&#8217;d like but it&#8217;ll do for free!

I&#8217;d actually like to build something similar to this, but a bit (maybe a lot) larger to accommodate bigger items and allow more flexibility as far as the angle of the shot.  Right now I feel like I&#8217;m pretty much required to have the camera pointing straight into the box and I can&#8217;t shoot anything that fills more than 1/3 or so of the box.

You can take a look at a few of the shots I took with it over <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/30398978@N04/sets/72157607215115568/">here</a>.
