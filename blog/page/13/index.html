  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just received an email today from one of my contacts on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a>.  It was an invitation to join this new <a href="http://www.unyk.com/">UNYK</a> Address Book application which is apparently in beta.</p>

<p>I think I&rsquo;ve made it clear that I&rsquo;m a <a href="/2008/09/09/livin-on-the-web/">big fan</a> of anything which centralizes my information and allows me to access it through a web browser from anywhere, so I checked it out.</p>

<p>Overall, it looks quite promising.  It will harvest your existing contacts from several different locations (Yahoo!, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft Outlook, MSN, etc.) and consolidate them.  When you sign up you provide your personal and professional contact information, and this in turn keeps your contact record up to date for anyone who has you in their address book.  Their premise is that everyone will eventually use them to manage their contact information, and therefore your address book will always be &ldquo;automatically&rdquo; up to date, because all of your contacts will have updated their information with UNYK.</p>

<p>My first, and perhaps biggest problem with the service is that they don&rsquo;t provide an <a href="https://">https://</a> option.  So as I&rsquo;m entering all of this personal and professional data, as well as supplying my login credentials for these other services it&rsquo;s all going across the wire in plain text!</p>

<p>My second problem is that I&rsquo;m already using <a href="https://www.goosync.com/">GooSync</a> to store my contacts, and then synchronize them with my HTC phone, which is my life line as far as contact information is concerned.</p>

<p>There is also some considerable controversy regarding the fact that it will effectively &ldquo;spam&rdquo; the contacts that you do import inviting them to join UNYK as well.  This is no doubt how the email was sent to me.  I&rsquo;m less concerned about this than the previous two points however.</p>

<p>So in order for me to fully embrace this new UNYK solution, it&rsquo;ll have to get a &ldquo;secure&rdquo; presence, and either integrate (which they seem to already do quite well with several other services) with GooSync, or provide the same functionality (syncing with my HTC).</p>

<p>Seems like a cool idea, but it&rsquo;s not quite mature enough for me to dive in head first.  I&rsquo;ll keep an eye out though!</p>

<p>EDIT:
Since I was more than a little bit surprised that there was no secure access to login and supply my credential for other services, I did a little further digging.  UNYK insists in their <a href="http://www.unyk.com/en/Confidentiality">privacy policy</a> that they encrypt any &ldquo;sensitive data&rdquo; that goes across the wire.  Here it is directly from their site.</p>

<blockquote>How Secure Are Your Web Servers?    [ ^ ]
The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
To learn more about SSL, follow this link http://www.verisign.com/products-services/security-services/ssl/index.html.

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.

Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

<p>So, since it looked like they used a lot of Web 2.0 technologies I thought possibly they were doing some javascript magic to encrypt the stuff going across the wire, I did a little test with <a href="http://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a> to see what got sent.  I bit the bullet and imported my gmail contacts, and this was the result, with the password obscured by me, of course.</p>

<p>Clearly not secure.  I do have to admit however that I seem to have been wrong about the mobile sync, they do provide this, though I&rsquo;ll have no idea how well it works until they fix the security problem.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I performed my search for the perfect <a href="/2008/09/25/photo-sharing-services/">photo sharing</a> solution, I fell in love with the Picasa desktop application.  I even discovered that there is a linux version.  However, as you&rsquo;d likely expect, it didn&rsquo;t really play nice as far as uploading photos to any photo sharing site other than Google&rsquo;s Picasa Web Albums.</p>

<p>On windows, there is a great solution called <a href="http://jerryong.com/blog/2008/06/picasa2flickr-uploads-your-picasa-photos-directly-to-flickr/">picasa2flickr</a> which passes the desired photo&rsquo;s to the windows <a href="http://www.flickr.com/tools/uploadr/">Flickr Uploader</a>.  Again, for obvious reasons, this doesn&rsquo;t work well on linux.</p>

<p>So, having determined that it wasn&rsquo;t worth my time to pursue trying to get Flickr uploads working from Picasa on Linux, I started evaluating many of the other native options on linux, such as digikam and fspot.  While these more easily uploaded to Flickr, and had open API&rsquo;s, none of them worked quite the way I wanted, so I abandoned my search for a good solution.</p>

<p>Then, on a whim I did a Google search just a couple hours after Andy O&#8217;Neill made a <a href="http://ultrahigh.org/2008/12/09/picflick-picasa-to-flickr-export-on-linux/">blog post</a> about a button he wrote to import photos to Flickr from the Linux version of Picasa, named picflick.</p>

<p>I eagerly (re)installed Picasa3 on my Gentoo box using a beta ebuild found <a href="http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=240406">here</a>.  Then installed his button.</p>

<p>After playing with it for a bit, I realized a few things didn&rsquo;t quite jive for me.</p>

<p>1) The script automatically resizes the image before uploading it to Flickr.  I prefer to upload all of my images at their original resolution, so this was a bit of a road block for me.</p>

<p>2) The script used a Perl module to upload to Flickr.  For the life of me, I couldn&rsquo;t seem to figure out how to get it authorized with my Flickr account to actually permit uploads.  I&rsquo;m sure if I spent a bit more time and read a few more manuals I could have gotten it right, but it didn&rsquo;t quite work &ldquo;out-of-the-box&rdquo; for me.</p>

<p>3) I&rsquo;d prefer to see the progress being made, rather than the beeps and tray notifications that Andy&rsquo;s script provided.</p>

<p>So, I stole the key part of his script, the part which translates Windows paths to *nix ones, and broke down the rest to simply pass the photos on to my preferred linux Flickr uploader, <a href="http://kflickr.sourceforge.net/wikka.php?wakka=Kflickr">KFlickr</a></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the contents of my script, including the win2native function written by Andy.</p>

<pre lang="bash" line="1">
#!/bin/bash

DEBUG=1     # debug to $LOG
LOG=/tmp/picflick.log
PICASA_WINE_DIR="$HOME/.google\/picasa\/3.0\/drive_c"  # Relative to $HOME
PICASA_WINE_DIR_NATIVE=`echo $PICASA_WINE_DIR |sed 's|\\\\||g'`

function debug() {
        if [ $DEBUG -eq 1 ]; then
                echo "$*" >> $LOG
        fi
}

# wine2native(): convert wine filename to native linux filenames
# Arguments: _name_ of variable which holds path
# Example: wine2native file  # not wine2native $file
function wine2native() {
        VAR=$1
        eval "VAL=\$$1"
        debug "Wine path: $VAL"
        # use '|' to delimit the paths
        VAL=`echo "$VAL" | \
                sed "s|C:|$PICASA_WINE_DIR|" | \
                sed 's|\\\\|/|g'`
        debug "Source file: $VAL"
        eval "$VAR=\$VAL"
}

# check we have the required dependencies
which kflickr > /dev/null || die "You need to install kflickr"

file=$1
wine2native file
DIR=`dirname "$file"`
EXT=${file##*.}
debug "START_UPLOAD"
for file in "$@"; do
        wine2native file
        KFLICKR="$KFLICKR $file"
done

debug "Launching kflickr with the following args $KFLICKR"
kflickr $KFLICKR

debug "Done"
</pre>


<p>Now when I click the &ldquo;Flickr&rdquo; button in Picasa, it brings up the KFlickr app with all the pictures I selected ready to upload.  Thanks for the inspiration, and code bits to make this work Andy, I was too lazy to actually figure out what was necessary to pull the image paths from Picasa and use them.</p>

<p>What you&rsquo;ve just seen is the latest marketing campaign by Burger King.  Every time I see teasers for this on TV, I feel&hellip;  I dunno..  Just&hellip;  Wrong.</p>

<p>Something about this offends me, and I&rsquo;m not really sure what it is yet.  There are <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/3546969/Burger-King-under-fire-for-Whopper-Virgins-taste-test-challenge.html">others</a> who feel very strongly about it.  I&rsquo;m not sure I agree with any one of those opinions directly.  But something about this just doesn&rsquo;t set right with me.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d wager that if Burger King were doing this as a purely altruistic endeavor, by providing food to remote villages without the marketing spin people might feel differently, myself in included.  However, as it stands, it feels awfully exploitative for the sake of marketing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Okay, if you thought the idea of a lightweight <a href="/2008/11/03/45l-duramax-saturn-sky/">sports car</a> with a big diesel v8 was exciting, consider this.</p>

<p>There is a kit car company out there named <a href="http://www.factoryfive.com/index.html">Factory Five</a> that makes various kit cars.  Cobra replicas, hot rods, and perhaps most interestingly, a &ldquo;build it yourself&rdquo; <a href="http://www.factoryfive.com/gtmhome.html">super car</a>.</p>

<p>Now the GTM super car kit is designed to be built mostly from 5th generation corvette parts, including the LS1 motor that&rsquo;s usually under the hood.  Now, we&rsquo;ve already established that the 4.5L duramax due in 2010 is designed to fit in the same envelop as the average LS series gas motor, and for the time being, I&rsquo;m going to stick to my assertion that the bellhousing bolt pattern will remain the same.  If all that turns out to be reality, this vehicle is practically designed to take the 4.5L duramax!  Sure, some intake and exhaust work will be necessary to point stuff out the other direction, however the &ldquo;inverse&rdquo; design of the intake an exhaust (exhaust ports and turbo live in the &ldquo;V&rdquo; of the motor, and intake is on the outside of the heads) might make this modification fairly easy.</p>

<p>Even at ~340hp, this thing should do 0-60 in around 3.5 seconds and put down a very low 11 second &frac14; mile!  The best part is, where my proposed Saturn Sky would be near the limits of traction and structural rigidity, this vehicle is DESIGNED for big power and huge stresses.  When the aftermarket catches up with the 4.5L, imagine how this thing would perform with over 500hp and 800-900ft/lbs torque!</p>

<p>Including the kit, the required C5 parts, and acquiring the new 4.5L duramax I imagine you could build one of these for under $70k.  Just imagine!  You&rsquo;d have something that out runs and out guns just about any super car ever built, and still knock down huge MPG numbers when you stay out of the loud pedal.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to start saving my pennies now.  ;&ndash;)</p>

Just became aware of the Tea Fire after driving home.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re actually further away from this fire than we were from the Gap Fire, but this one &ldquo;feels&rdquo; closer because it&rsquo;s much more clearly visible from our home.  The above image is from just outside our back door of our apartment.</p>

<p>So far the air quality is quite bearable, though we&rsquo;re having to keep the doors and windows closed to keep my wife&rsquo;s asthma from flaring up.</p>

<p>You can see all my pictures, right from behind our apartment on my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rgeyer/sets/72157609035026410/">Flickr stream</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So we just recently got a new sectional.  In order to make space for it, we put our old recliner sofa in the back of my truck, and hauled it away.  Of course, this meant I had to remove my car pc from the back of my explorer.  Unfortunately, I didn&rsquo;t tidy up the loose cables that were left behind before we put the couch in.</p>

<p>The result?  I bent a bunch of the pins on my VGA connector on the cable to my 8&#8221; Lilliput touch screen.  I tried bending them back, but they simply broke.  So the only solution is to put a new connector on.</p>

<p>Now the Lilliput proprietary cable carries the VGA signal and the USB signal for the touchscreen.  In total there are 9 wires.  Of course, I had to figure out the pinout in order to connect everything back up.</p>

<p>Using a multimeter and some trial and error I figured it out for my cable.  It might fit be the same for others, it might not but this info might be useful for somebody.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since the first time I saw the Saturn Sky Roadster I fell in love with it.  Though, with my particular passion for diesel I&rsquo;d love to see one with a diesel motor.</p>

<p>Well, in 2010 GM is planning to release a <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2007/06/15/gm-announces-clean-diesel-v8-for-pickups-and-the-hummer-h2/">4.5L V8 Duramax.</a>  All of the marketing materials and announcements say that it&rsquo;s being designed to fit into the space of an LS small block, so pretty much anywhere a current GM v8 fits, this thing will too.  And it&rsquo;s currently being estimated at ~345hp!</p>

<p>This is good news, cause there are already several folks who have swapped LS1s and LS7s into Sky&rsquo;s and Solstices, and even some people making <a href="http://www.mallettcars.com/sky-conversion.htm">aftermarket kits</a>.</p>

<p>Now no one has said anything about if the 4.5 Duramax will have the same bolt pattern for the bellhousing as an LS, but it&rsquo;s probably a safe bet that it will.</p>

<p>A sky equipped this way should be able to out perform all but the most elite Corvette, and knock down 35+ MPG on the highway.  Yum!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Time for the second installment of my worklog for my <a href="/2008/09/05/the-upgrade-begins/">PC Upgrade</a>.</p>

<p>Well, I actually received all the bits from UPS Monday (is it Thursday already? sheesh).  I actually assembled the thing Monday afternoon/evening, and have been slowly installing software and getting it up to speed.</p>

<p>For the curious, and so I can brag a bit heres the parts list.</p>

<ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817104954">FSP Group SAGA+ 450R 450W ATX12V Power Supply</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811119106">    COOLER MASTER Centurion 534 RC-534-KKN2-GP Black Aluminum & Mesh bezel / SECC Chassis ATX Mid Tower Computer Case</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813121314">Intel BOXDP35DPM LGA 775 Intel P35 ATX Intel Motherboard - Retail</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819115017">Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600 Kentsfield 2.4GHz 2 x 4MB L2 Cache LGA 775 Quad-Core Processor</a></li>
    <li>4 x 2GB = 8GB<a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820134636"> Kingston 2GB 240-Pin DDR2 SDRAM DDR2 800 (PC2 6400)</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814130378">EVGA 512-P3-N954-TR GeForce 9500 GT 512MB</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822148288">Seagate Barracuda 7200.11 ST3500320AS 500GB 7200 RPM</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Now, this isn&rsquo;t quite bleeding edge stuff but it certainly brings me up to date and I&rsquo;m quite happy.  Because I wanted just a ROCK SOLID setup and wasn&rsquo;t intending to overclock, I went with an Intel motherboard.  I didn&rsquo;t want to regret not getting enough memory, so I maxxed it out with 8GB.  I don&rsquo;t really game so the video card is nothing special, but I did want enough horsepower to drive my big monitor and take advantage of Vista&rsquo;s Aero theme and some of the cool linux eye candy that&rsquo;s in KDE4 etc.  I am NOT disappointed!</p>

<p>So far I&rsquo;ve gotten Gentoo linux installed on the system.  The speed of compiling is admirable though not mind blowing.  One of the first things I installed though was <a href="http://cinelerra.org/">Cinelerra</a> and I loaded up some of my HDV source material.  While I should have expected as much I was able to play, edit, and render the HD in realtime!  WOO HOO!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m quite impressed with Gentoo, no hardware headaches, everything more-or-less worked out of the box.  I haven&rsquo;t quite got all my favorite apps installed and running but I trust it will be uneventful.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m in the process of moving my drives/data over from my old system.  I had a software RAID1 setup using mdadm which I&rsquo;ve been able to bring back up on the new box.  Going to play with a RAID5 since I now have enough disks, and maybe simulate a failure to test recovery.  This should get my confidence up for building a linux software based RAID5 NAS box which is the next project.</p>

<p>The other night, I couldn&rsquo;t resist the urge to capture this image.  The moon was shining brightly through our bathroom window casting the shadow of the tree and fence(s) behind our apartment.</p>

<p>This was the photo I liked the most, but you can see all the shots I took over at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rgeyer/sets/72157608047756459/">Flickr</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I tend to have lots of ideas about project cars that I think are pretty cool.  The chances are I won&rsquo;t ever build any of them, but I figured I could start documenting them here just for fun, or on the odd chance that somebody reads my ideas and decides to build one of them.</p>

<p>So, for my first submission..</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been interested in the early to mid 70&rsquo;s datsun z for some time.  I even bought the &ldquo;jags-that-run&rdquo; book on converting one to a chevy 350 drivetrain.  I&rsquo;m still very interested owning one of these cars and doing an engine swap.  Here&rsquo;s what I think would be cool.</p>

<p>Take a 3.0L diesel, the modern common rail motor that is also dubbed &ldquo;Blutec&rdquo; when all of the emissions magic is done on it, out of a wrecked Mercedes and stuff it into a 240z.  Yeah, there are bigger badder diesel motors but they are heavier and would extend past the front axle of the z.  I&rsquo;m looking for a small, fast, but most importantly agile car.</p>

<p>Of course, the ideal transmission for this would be a true 6 speed manual, but no production vehicle with the 3.0L has one so getting the computer to cooperate, and mating up a manual may be more trouble than it&rsquo;s worth.  However, if you carried over the 7 speed automatic from the Benz and fashioned a paddle type shifter to activate the up and down shifts (should be possible since there is an &ldquo;automanual&rdquo; setting for the Benz that&rsquo;s clearly electronically triggered) it should still be a heck of a lotta fun in the twisties.</p>
