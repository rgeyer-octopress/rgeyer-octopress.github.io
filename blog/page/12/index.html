<h2>date: 2009-11-02 00:00:00 -0700</h2>

<p>Man, nearly two months without a post here.  Google Analytics tells me I&#8217;m only disappointing about two dozen people, so to you my loyal readers, accept my humblest apologies.  But, I do have an excuse or two!</p>




<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rgeyer/4056790007/" title="Marathon Conference Calls by qwikrex, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3021/4056790007_3a2ae48a63_m.jpg" width="240" height="225" alt="Marathon Conference Calls" class="alignleft" /></a>See, I&#8217;ve been working an insane work schedule.  Pretty much 16-18hours a day 6-7 days a week, mostly on phone calls with an offshore team at odd hours.  When I do have a moment or two that I&#8217;m not working, you can bet the last thing I want to be doing is sitting in front of a computer typing a blog post.</p>




<p>To add to that, we moved out of our two bedroom townhouse at the beginning of October, and are just getting fully settled into our new place.  I&#8217;m TOTALLY excited about the new house.  We&#8217;ve got three bedrooms and one and a half baths, it&#8217;s single story which is great because Q can roam around as he pleases.  It&#8217;s also got a great, and quite large sun room that opens into the backyard, this has become Q&#8217;s defacto playroom which is excellent.  Plus, we&#8217;ve got a bigger kitchen, a proper dining area where we can sit and eat as a family, and I have my very own office and *drumroll* TWO CAR GARAGE!</p>




<p>Now that we&#8217;re settled in the new house, and the deadline for work is approaching things are starting to drift back toward &#8220;normal&#8221; as if there is such a thing for our family.  I even managed to grab a couple hours to work on the Cadillac today, and write this blog entry!  HUZZAH!</p>




<p>In the meantime, my wife has done an excellent job of providing content since I made her an author here to.  You may have noticed <!--<a href="#">&#8211;>her posts<!--</a>&#8211;>.  I&#8217;m totally stoked to have her writing here since I strongly believe she has a future in writing short stories or novels!  I still have two or three of her drafts which I need to review and publish.  And no, I&#8217;m not doing a macho &#8220;you need me to post for you, you don&#8217;t have the permissions&#8221; thing, she&#8217;s just not confident enough yet to post without me reviewing/editing.  We&#8217;ll change that soon enough.  ;-)</p>




<p>Stay tuned to this space for more, as I&#8217;ll be trying to actually keep things up to date again.  :-)</p>

<h2>date: 2009-10-16 00:00:00 -0700</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rgeyer/3933790789/" title="family_chariot.jpg by qwikrex, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3489/3933790789_79042eb69d_m.jpg" alt="family_chariot.jpg" class="alignleft"/></a>I have had a great interest in cars for much of my life, it has been a means of freedom to me.  I am a little prejudice when it comes to brands when it comes to vehicles, and you can tell what I prefer by looking at the makes of the cars I have owned in my short life.  I have had a &#8216;91 Honda civic, &#8216;92 Lexus, and &#8216;06 Honda odyssey.</p>




<p>My mother&#8217;s history of cars haven&#8217;t been all that grand.  She had an Ford escort when I was little and due to not changing a belt the engine was destroyed, sadly from then on my entire family got a bitter taste in their mouth from that experience.  Then my mom had a four door VW rabbit, while my father drove a GTI.  Mom&#8217;s car was named Tweetie as it was  yellow and just a sweet little car, while my father&#8217;s was named Thumper as it was a fast car and when he shifted there was a bit of thumping as he shifted hard and fast.</p>




<p>The next car was a Sunbird and it was a tired, tired car.  My mom bought it from my father&#8217;s girlfriend at a steal but honestly the mistress of the hour should have paid her to take it off her hands.  I remember the roof was only foam and would shed every time we got into it, and a pen was the shifter.  My mom needed a car, only for a short while as my mother finally left my father and relocated to be closer to her family.</p>




<p>The next family car was a Toyota Corona and I would spend my days sitting in the car pretending to drive, pretend shifting in the driver&#8217;s seat.  I just imagined driving for a long time and merely stopping to have an adventure where ever the road led me.   Then my mom got an old Honda Accord, and we were all so proud of her.  It was a fantastic car that lasted for 7/8 years, turned out she got the one year of Accord that wasn&#8217;t that great and when it died, it died.  They didn&#8217;t release that car in Japan which meant replacement engines were incredibly expensive.</p>




<p>By that time I was figuring out what my next car would be as my &#8216;91 civic hatch back simply didn&#8217;t feel all that adult.  I sold it to my mother for a steal and bought myself my 92 Lexus.  The civic took care of my mom for six months then began to putter and act up then we helped her shop for her current car, a Nissan Sentra.  The husband fixed the civic which was renamed Put-Put as it became my little sister&#8217;s.  Put put was just traded in for a Accord coupe as my sister was craving more horse power and something with a/c.</p>




<p>That is my current car history, nothing compared to my husbands, but three cars fit me and I love to do the long haul with cars.  I also get emotionally attached so there is no reason to replace or trade cars all that often for me.  I think one of the reasons my husband loves me is because we can talk about cars and have a debate as he is open to almost any and all makes and models, while I tend to lean toward the Japanese cars as they have been fantastic to both myself and my family.  Hey, if it isn&#8217;t Japanese or German, my family has little to no interest.  Terrible but true.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rgeyer/4009626349/" title="Moving Boxes by qwikrex, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2605/4009626349_27b238c45e.jpg" width="363" height="500" alt="Moving Boxes" class="alignright" /></a>I was raised as a sort of nomad.  I have moved multiple times during my life, went to 5 elementary schools.  I was used to it.  It was always due to circumstance, trying to make a better life for the family.  I got used to being the new girl.  I just completed my third move as a married woman, my first move as a mom.</p>




<p>Let me just say, moving is for the young.  I was reminded of muscles I forgot I had and was reminded that I am definitely getting older.  Oh, and packing with a toddler is an marathon sport.  You pack, the child gets excited and unpacks you before you turn around to tape up a box.  Your habit of powering through until you are done are sanctioned by your child&#8217;s needs and wants.  Just because you have 15 more boxes to pack doesn&#8217;t mean that your child will willingly entertain himself for the 45 minutes you need.  Even though he usually plays by himself for an hour around that time.  Nope, your schedule has changed therefore so has your child&#8217;s.</p>




<p>I have to admit I was blown away by his hysterical antics during the process.  Q has become incredibly vocal about everything.  He seems, like his parents, to have an opinion about nearly everything.  I love that he realizes now that speaking up and communicating is much more effective than screaming and whimpering.</p>




<p>I am now living in my first house in seven years, I still can&#8217;t believe it.  I am simply blown away.  My son is thrilled with the space, my husband is over the moon with the garage and office space he now has.  I am just overwhelmed and kind of miss being able to see and hear everything going on in my home at all times.</p>




<p>I don&#8217;t miss hearing my neighbors bathing at midnight.  I don&#8217;t miss worrying about our movie being too loud for our neighbors or having a migraine and praying they don&#8217;t watch a movie that night.  Parking is less of an issue, that is very exciting.  The yard is much more private, I don&#8217;t always have to greet neighbors when chasing my child into the apartment.  What can I say?  I am a girl that enjoys her privacy.</p>




<p>I feel like we are entering a new era.  We were kind of hip and city dwellers when we lived in our apartment (not that we were ever really hip).  Now we are further from town and surrounded by families, minivans are everywhere out here.  Which is both comforting and terrifying.</p>




<p>Though we have some more work to do, my tired old butt would love to be done with this moving business.  So for now, today, this evening, I am sooo done!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rgeyer/3075892157/" target="_blank"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3138/3075892157_40c4001af8.jpg" alt="Paradigmn Mini Monitor Speaker" class="alignright"/></a>Today on my lovely morning walk I was listening to my favorite Pandora station and heard the Isley Brothers &#8216;Footsteps in the Dark&#8217; and all that kept playing in my head is &#8216;It was a good day&#8217; by Ice Cube.  I then recalled all the times I would get excited over a &#8216;new&#8217; song and my mother would immediately let me know that either it was sampled from another song or a remake of a song that I should listen to.  In the beginning I would fight valiantly determined to prove that she was wrong, but in a short period of time she would prove she was right and in this process she imparted a great respect of &#8216;older&#8217; music.</p>




<p>I have lived with many different family members which has helped form who I am in a multitude of ways.  I am in awe of how much it has formed my tastes in music.  Music is huge in all parts of my family, everyone has a passion about some genre.  One aunt insists on listening to her favorite motown or country while we eat.  My uncle and mother have a soft spot for anything Luther Vandross, the even saw him perform together.  My paternal grandmother loves gospel, and soul music.</p>




<p>The moment my husband, then fiance, went out to visit my Father&#8217;s side of the family he proved himself to be a good choice when given permission to play my late grandfather&#8217;s records and had most of us remembering a plethora of great memories.  He just kept choosing songs on different albums that either made us laugh while reminiscing or just look at each other with tears in our eyes knowingly.  Shortly after that My grandmother, my aunt, my father, even some of my cousins let me know that he was a good choice and he was approved.</p>




<p>I met my husband because of music.  He was the DJ at a cousin&#8217;s wedding, he was cute, and he was the only single man at the venue I wasn&#8217;t related to.  I asked him to dance and from the moment on both of us were twitterpated.  The moment I knew that he was something special was when he sang to me while going for a drive.  The moment I knew that he was &#8216;the one&#8217; we were listening to the radio while watching the fire works for the fourth of July.  It is only appropriate that a dancing fool marries a DJ.</p>




<p>I love to sing, though I rarely make anyone listen.  My adorable toddler boy regularly sings along with anything and everything.  Thankfully we think we are raising yet another music lover.  Music is just such a moving wonderful thing.  I wonder just how quiet and boring life would be without music. ::shudders::  Never mind, too quiet, must search out more music.</p>

<h2>date: 2009-09-30 00:00:00 -0700</h2>

<p>Of late the hubs and I have been trying to do everything at once.  Weaning our son, and encouraging him to sleep in his own bed.  Both of us have been crazy busy with our jobs.  We have been searching for a new home to rent.  I have been attempting to get in better shape so as to be able to keep up with a baby boy and keep my health in check to the best of my abilities.  We keep trying to keep our home clean, which seems to only last for a moment after cleaning.  Trying to really take the time to catch up with each other and making sure both of us are really getting the down time that we need.  It simply has been crazy.</p>

<p>Now we are recovering from a long weekend of attempting to do all of it, and do it well.  My son is finally sleeping for a good stretch.  It is peaceful in my home right now.</p>

<p>I just saw a LOVELY home that I want to live in but it is simply too small for our needs.  The home we looked at last night is simply bigger than we need.  I am so bummed that we can&rsquo;t make the charming little place work.  Did I mention that my husband is chomping at the bit when it comes to the larger home?  <em>sigh</em></p>

<p>I am just trying to figure out how to make everything fit in our lives and make sure nothing is being neglected.  To be a good woman, a good wife, a good mother, a good daughter, a good sister&hellip;it is a hell of a lot to juggle.  I am learning but dear lord, every time I think I have everything under control something new pops up.  I can&rsquo;t wait till the home search is done.</p>

<p>Yep, here I go talking about boobies again.
I am currently awake at the wondrous hour of 3am because my beautiful precious son is awake and has nursing needs but I announced that I am done breastfeeding my son and want a break.  I explained to my ever loving husband that Thursday night will be the last time our son will nurse because I just can&rsquo;t handle the draining of my energy and the lack of sleep, I just couldn&rsquo;t do it anymore.</p>

<p>So as we make it through our first night attempting wean him completely we slowly worked out a plan.  Bottle of warm cows milk and Sprout while keeping me hiding in our living room until I am texted that is safe to return.  This our second round, which to be honest is a surprise.  I didn&rsquo;t expect to get any sleep and I was able to get a whole four hours so far.</p>

<p>I must admit, part of me was really hoping that the hubs would do this wake up so it was a little smoother of a transition but I reacted like usual and woke up enough to cuddle in hopes that is all my son wanted.  My attempts were futile and he kept trying to find my breast so as to latch on for a wee hour morning snack.  Finally I sucked it up and kissed our son good bye and ran down stairs to start warming up some milk for his next bottle.  The crying ensued and I felt like the 45 seconds were the longest EVER.  Then I came back to a fumbling husband trying to soothe our toddler in the dark, not only was he awake to help me but he even was standing and rocking our baby boy.</p>

<p>I am now downstairs listening to my son randomly share his disappointment that I didn&rsquo;t just join him and offer my breast.  I am not sure if the powers of Sprout have been used just yet but my son doesn&rsquo;t sound interested in any of this kicking the habit of the ta-tas.</p>

<p>I love you little man, but this is for the best for us all.  Momma just can&rsquo;t do the breast-feeding anymore.  Momma needs her rest and would love to be done with your stage of nursing.</p>

<h2>date: 2009-09-17 00:00:00 -0700</h2>

<p>Okay I know what you&#8217;re thinking, and no I didn&#8217;t figure out how to turn a <a href="http://shop.radiopopper.com/radiopopperjrxreceiverbasicusca.aspx" target="_blank">basic reciever</a> into a <a href="http://shop.radiopopper.com/radiopopperjrxreceiverstudiousca.aspx" target="_blank">studio receiver</a>, but sadly, I&#8217;m simply not that cool.  What I did do however was open the boxes for my two new RadioPopper JrX Studio receivers, put batteries in them, test them (oohh pretty), then instantly void their warranties.  Why you ask?  Because I can.  Also because there were just a couple design choices which weren&#8217;t convenient for me so I wanted to tweak them to fit my workflow and needs a little better.</p>




<p>So, as part of my <a href="/2009/09/13/you-get-what-you-pay-for-or-less/" target="_blank">aforementioned shopping spree</a> I decided it was time to upgrade my wireless triggering system.  I was previously using the &#8220;Cactus v2s&#8221; triggers, which worked reasonably well but had limited range and reliability in spite of the fact that I performed <a href="http://jeremykuster.blogspot.com/2007/10/gi-cactus-v2s-modification-tutorial.html" target="_blank">hacks</a> on those as well.  My choice for a replacement is the JrX system from <a href="http://radiopopper.com" target="_blank">RadioPopper</a>.  In my case, one transmitter, and two Studio receivers.  The studio receiver allows you to control the output of up to three groups of the White Lightning or AlienBees studio strobes and/or TTL Nikon or Canon speedlights (with yet to be released RPCubes).  This works well for me because I have some old and new Nikon flashes with TTL, and when I step up to studio strobes, I&#8217;ll likely choose White Lightning and/or AlienBees.</p>




<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rgeyer/3930133107/" target="_blank"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2480/3930133107_ff5ffe3d73_m.jpg" alt="Lanyard Mount" class="alignright" /></a>So now to the nitty gritty stuff.  Just like on my old Cactus triggers, I really wanted a nice way to mount or hang these triggers on a light stand.  When I modded my Cactus triggers, I went a little crazy and bought 100 lanyards so I had plenty to spare.  Sadly the receiver didn&#8217;t have any built in place to mount one, so I went searching for an appropriate place.  I finally decided on putting it just below the data port which (if you&#8217;re looking at it from the front) is on the left side of the trigger.  There is space there to drill two small 3/32 holes pretty close together to thread the lanyard through.</p>




<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rgeyer/3930132757/" target="_blank"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2493/3930132757_a402fd6bda_m.jpg" alt="Battery wires connected to circuit board" class="alignleft" /></a>The other thing which bothered me about the receivers was the special battery that was required.  Now, to the credit of RadioPopper, they chose a battery which is common enough that there is a market of rechargeable versions (the CR123A).  And, even better David over at <a href="http://www.strobist.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Strobist</a> has done the hard work of finding a good package and strategy for keeping charged batteries in your gear.  There&#8217;s a hitch though.  The rechargeables will slowly discharge on the shelf or in my camera bag.  I&#8217;m an amateur/hobbiest, and as such I only break out strobes and wireless triggers maybe once or twice a week.  Chances are I&#8217;d have to replace the batteries just about every time I pulled my triggers out for use!  Okay, so that&#8217;s an exaggeration, but stick with me for the punchline there are other reasons the battery RadioPopper chose doesn&#8217;t quite work for me.</p>




<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rgeyer/3930910642/" target="_blank"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2521/3930910642_84e79eb59e_m.jpg" alt="Battery mounted to JrX with velcro" class="alignright" /></a>Enter my second mod.  Just like the one on the Cactus triggers, I replaced the proprietary 3v battery with a pair of good old fashioned AA cells so I can use some of my standard NiMH rechargeable batteries.  Now, I know what you&#8217;re thinking, that I complained about the self discharge of the LiFeP04 battery and here I am replacing it with an even faster self discharging NiMH rechargeable?  Well, yes, and for a few good reasons.  First, I have a pretty good stock of rechargeable AA&#8217;s and chargers, and I have enough devices that run on them that I can be pretty confident I&#8217;ll have a charged up set ready for me when I&#8217;m shooting.  There is also the excellent <a href="http://www.eneloop.info/" target="_blank">Eneloop</a> NiMH battery which has a self discharge rate so low that you can consider it non existent for all practical uses.  And lastly, in a pinch, I can find a crappy set of AA&#8217;s just about anywhere, and their superior mAh (usually 2000 or greater for an average rechargable AA, vs 750 mAh for the CR123A rechargeable) means they&#8217;ll last longer during use, and have more capacity to self discharge giving me a bigger time buffer for storage.  In the end, it&#8217;s compelling enough for me to make the switch.</p>




<p>So there you have it, my two simple mods which make these great triggers just that much more user friendly for me.  You can see a few more pictures of the mods in my Flickr <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rgeyer/sets/72157622401801774/" target="_blank">photostream</a>.  All of those photos were taken with a Nikon SB24 which was triggered by a Radiopopper JrX receiver which was already modded, in case you were wondering if it worked.  ;-)  Now to wait impatiently for the RPCubes so I can control all my Nikon strobes!</p>

<h2>date: 2009-09-13 00:00:00 -0700</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rgeyer/3917686231/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3518/3917686231_f6e83b6b44_m.jpg" alt="Phoenix Flash" class="alignright" /></a>So you likely know that I recently dropped and broke my <a href="/2009/09/07/like-a-flash-in-the-pan/">Nikon SB600 flash</a>.  Disappointed as I was about this, I was already thinking of how I&#8217;d replace it.  My searches for Nikon compatible flashes had always included these apparently super affordable Phoenix flashes.  Now, of course, I was always very suspicious of these for a couple of reasons.  First, in all the auctions and other sites selling these I never saw information indicating if this had ANY manual control, and there was never a picture of the rear panel of the unit!  Second, there weren&#8217;t really any reviews of it online.  I found a few, but usually it was on something like Amazon where it was fairly apparent that those reviewing were (at best) uninformed users who wouldn&#8217;t know the difference between a &#8220;good&#8221; flash and a bad one.</p>




<p>In spite of those facts though, I convinced myself that spending $80 to find out if the thing is any good couldn&#8217;t hurt, right?  Wrong!  The thing got shipped reasonably quickly to me from the eBay seller, and upon opening it up it seemed like it had some potential.  Yes, it was kinda cheapy plastic and felt light, but that is what I expected for something so inexpensive.  The real dissappoinment came when I put it on my camera, and snapped a few shots.  You can see the results <a href="http://flickr.com/gp/rgeyer/2tZ4ie">here</a>.  Needless to say this thing, even when doing full power pops, can&#8217;t provide enough light to expose a shot properly.  This, in spite of the fact that it&#8217;s a big, imposing looking flash.  They did a lot to try to make it look like an SB800, hinting that it might actually have some decent performance.</p>




<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rgeyer/3918464666/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2528/3918464666_4f92a50c0a_m.jpg" alt="Back panel" class="alignleft" /></a>So now, to answer some questions I had about it.  This is strictly intended for use with iTTL.  The back panel just contains a couple switches, one to turn it on, and one to switch &#8220;modes, and a guide for ISO/zoom/distance that this flash supposedly covers.  The switch to change between &#8220;BL&#8221; and &#8220;STD&#8221; has absolutely no influence on the poor performance.  Using a Cactus v2s to pop it seems to do only a very low power pop and the flash does not seem to recharge afterward.</p>




<p>The zoom is manual which is to be expected, and goes from 28mm to 85mm.  When I zoomed it in to 85mm, and fired it I noticed some artifacts from the lens/diffuser which were distracting <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rgeyer/3918508030/">see here</a>.</p>




<p>My plan was to use it along with a Nikon SC-28 iTTL cable to simulate the way I was using my Nikon SB600 when <a href="/2009/09/06/of-living-insects-and-dying-electronics/">shooting butterflies</a> on the fateful day that I broke it.  I figured that I would lose some convenience having to go with a cable, and zoom the flash manually.  I didn&#8217;t anticipate that the thing wouldn&#8217;t have enough power to expose a frame properly!  So if you&#8217;re wondering if this thing is any good, and maybe thinking you&#8217;re willing to give up a little performance and convenience for a STEAL of a flash, think again.  You do, sadly, get what you pay for.</p>




<p>For what I did actually do to replace my Nikon SB600, stay tuned.  I went on a bit of an ill advised shopping spree, and have some exciting stuff headed my way!</p>

<p>Appearance, it is a topic that comes up regularly.  We all wish it wasn&rsquo;t what we are judged by but it is.  My question, or rant, is why does everyone need to fit in a box?</p>

<p>I am of mixed decent.  I am short and curvy, my hair style is a big afro, my skin is of olive tone.  To be honest I think I am cute.  I always have been told by friends, family and strangers that I am attractive.  I was raised not to put too much emphasis on how I look, it could be taken away in a second.  I was raised to search out the secret person of the heart.  I have learned that I am a pretty strong woman.  I&rsquo;m the kind of lady you want on your side instead of against you.  I love strongly and I am one eager to laugh at life.</p>

<p>My little sister</p>
</div>


<p>I know that I don&rsquo;t fit in a &lsquo;typical&rsquo; box, especially where I live.  I am the minority here.  I have been having conversations with my sister on the regular over appearance, mostly because we are different looking.  My sister is an adorable petite young woman.  She is an incredibly strong, intelligent, witty young lady.  We differ over how we like to look.  I love my curves while she is in toned and ready to run.  My sister can do make up like nobodies business, I am talking art worthy techniques.  While I am feeling very made up with powder, mascara and chapstick.   I rarely flat iron my hair, it is really hard to find someone I trust to do that professionally in town and it is hard to make that time to straighten out all of my hair.  My sister will flat iron her hair, maybe put in some clip in extensions and look absolutely FANTASTIC.  We are just different but in this town we both stick out majorly.</p>

<p>Me</p>
</div>


<p>I married a big blond white man, I married him because he is an incredible, incredible man.  This has added to my, I don&rsquo;t fit in to &lsquo;typical box&rsquo;.  Then I went and had his baby, and he looks like a lot like my husband, a lot.  This continued to point out how I am different.  Personally I like the fact that we are a multicultural home.  I love that we love each other for our differences.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know much else as my mother is a Latina and my father is African American, having more than one culture in a household is normal to me.  What I don&rsquo;t get is why people feel the need to point out that I am different.  Why they need to question if my child is my own.  Why they need to ask if I was adopted because my mother is light and doesn&rsquo;t obviously look African American.  Honestly, if you look at my mother and I closely we look a lot alike.  If you take a good look at my son and I, we look a lot alike.  Hell, if you look closely at my husband and I you would see we have similar facial features.  But you have to be able to look past the color of our skin.</p>

<p>I was taught to look beyond color, and I am proud of it, just a shame not everyone else was taught to do the same.  Try to take some time and open your eyes, we are a whole lot more alike than you may think.</p>

<h2>date: 2009-09-08 00:00:00 -0700</h2>

<p>I have been playing on a baby board since before my precious baby boy was conceived.  I have gotten to know quite a few women on these boards over the past three years, as much as you can get to know someone on a board on the internet.  Over the past few months I have read about pregnancy losses, from a chemical pregnancies to still births and after reading every single one I am left just heartbroken.</p>

<p>Generally after reading about another e-friend loosing a child that they hoped for I close my laptop and focus on my son.  Generally when I do this I either get kisses or pushed away as I have interrupted some of his quality play time that he enjoys doing alone.  He seems perfectly happy in his own little world knowing that mom or dad are close and ready to give him our full attention when he needs it.</p>

<p>Now as I read about yet another e-friend loosing her child late in her pregnancy, I am starting to just wonder why I am so selfish.  Why am I so focused on having another child?  Why is that the ongoing monologue going on in my mind?  I am so worried about giving my precious, beautiful baby boy a sibling.  Shouldn&rsquo;t I simply happy, with the blessing that I have been bestowed by having him and leave it at one child?</p>

<p>Sigh.  Kinda makes me want to drop my over analyzing, what if&rsquo;s of having another child and just enjoy the child that I have been fortunate to have.</p>

<p>To those women that I have read and posted to in their sad time after losing that child that they had hoped to have for so long:  You amaze me in your strength.  I hope nothing but the best for you and your families, and  (((((Hugs))))).</p>
