<p>First, I&rsquo;m amazed that I didn&rsquo;t mention this here yet!  The picture above is of my previous daily driver, a 1999 Ford Explorer.  On April 7th my wife was driving it home after a light rain, and while accellerating onto an onramp she lost control, spun around 180 degrees and rolled it one time.</p>

<p>Fortunately, she was mostly unharmed.  A few bruises, some cuts, and a few pounds of glass in her hair (only a slight exaggeration) was all she suffered.</p>

<p>I got our insurance company on the case the very next day, and they paid out in about 2.5 weeks from the initial claim.  &ldquo;In good hands&rdquo; indeed!  I paid the salvage fee so I could keep the wreck and part it out.</p>

<p>So, what I&rsquo;ve been busy with is dismantling this, working on a few computer jobs, and shopping for the X&rsquo;s successor.  And, I&rsquo;ve found it&hellip;</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">It&#8217;s a 1967 Cadillac Sedan Deville.  My wife, our son, and I all jumped into the van and drove down to LA this past weekend, and took a look at her.  I picked this car up for a cool $1000, and promptly scheduled an auto transport company to tote it from Fontana to our door step in Santa Barbara.</p>


<p style="text-align: left;">As we speak it should be getting loaded onto the auto transport rig, and I should have it here by tomorrow.</p>


<p style="text-align: left;">Stay tuned as I have LOTS in store for this car since it&#8217;ll be my new project, and daily driver!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the past few weeks I&rsquo;ve been spending most of my spare time developing a couple of web sites.  These sites are based on the Drupal CMS written in PHP.  And I&rsquo;ve taken a bit of a crash course in Drupal module design.</p>

<p>When I set out developing these, I faced a challenge that I&rsquo;d been aware of, but managed to avoid in the past.  How do I work on these projects in a predictable, constant environment, and still bring my code with me to work on my home machine, work machine, laptop, and anything else I happen to sit down in front of?</p>

<p>This blog post is about how I&rsquo;ve accomplished this so far.  Read more after the break&hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Okay, so I&#8217;ve been a bit preoccupied with a couple projects which have slowed my efforts at blogging etc.</p>


<p>In both cases, I&#8217;ve been working on websites that leverage the PHP based Drupal CMS.&nbsp; One of those projects is over at <a href="http://www.chasejarvisshoeproject.com">http://www.chasejarvisshoeproject.com</a>.&nbsp; That site is basically a small community forum for some folks that are sending a pair of shoes around the world, and taking pictures of them in various locations and situations.&nbsp; Pretty cool.&nbsp; The result of this effort is a Flickr photo pool and a good time.</p>


<p>So, of course a website devoted to a group on Flickr, is going to require some integration with Flickr.&nbsp; Enter the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/flickr">Drupal Flickr Module</a>.&nbsp; When I&nbsp;started using it, this module was still in either an alpha, or beta (can&#8217;t seem to remember) and has released it&#8217;s 1.0 as of the 25th of March.&nbsp; Throughout the time I&#8217;ve been using it however, there&#8217;ve been a few functions of the Flickr API which I&nbsp;needed, and the module didn&#8217;t support.&nbsp; Those were.</p>


<ul>
    <li><a href="http://flickr.com/services/api/flickr.groups.pools.getPhotos.html">flickr.groups.pools.getPhotos</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://flickr.com/services/api/flickr.urls.getGroup.html">flickr.urls.getGroup</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://flickr.com/services/api/flickr.urls.getUserPhotos.html">flickr.urls.getUserPhotos</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Since the framework of the module did the hard work of making the calls, it was easy to write my own methods which performed these Flickr API&nbsp;functions for me.&nbsp; And as the module developers released new versions, I&nbsp;just copy/pasted my code back into the new file, and went about my business.</p>


<p>Well when 1.0 was released, I&nbsp;took a closer look.&nbsp; It turns out they&#8217;d implemented the call to get photos from a group pool, but still nothing for the URL&#8217;s.&nbsp; So I&nbsp;figured I&#8217;d contribute and write a patch for the two calls I&nbsp;was still in need of.&nbsp; And that, is what you see here.</p>


<pre lang="diff">
569,597d568
< }
< 
< /** 
<  * @param $nsid
<  *   nsid of the group whose pool url will be returned
<  * @return 
<  *   The URL portion of the response from the flickr method flickr.urls.getGroup
<  */
< function flickr_urls_get_group($nsid)
< {
<   $response = flickr_request('flickr.urls.getGroup', array('group_id' => $nsid));
< if($response)
<     return $response['group']['url'];
<     
<   return FALSE;
< }
< 
< /**
<  * @param $nsid
<  *   nsid of the user whose photostream url will be returned
<  * @return unknown_type
<  */
< function flickr_urls_get_user_photos($nsid)
< {
<   $response = flickr_request('flickr.urls.getUserPhotos', array('user_id' => $nsid));
< if($response)
<     return $response['user']['url'];
<     
<   return FALSE;
</pre>


<p>As you can see, pretty basic but I&nbsp;figured I&#8217;d contribute.&nbsp; I&nbsp;posted this as a feature request/issue over on the Flickr Module&#8217;s <a href="http://drupal.org/node/414096">issue queue</a>, but have yet to receive a response.&nbsp; If nothing else, I&nbsp;can use this to patch the next version.&nbsp; Hopefully it helps someone else as well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Okay, first..&nbsp; This post/rant was inspired by a few tweets from Chase Jarvis.&nbsp; That said, I&#8217;m not throwing stones, or trying to start a fight.&nbsp; The topic just got me thinking and I&nbsp;wanted to share my train of thought.&nbsp; Chase, and any other professional who shots tethered, I&#8217;m actually jealous.&nbsp; I&nbsp;wish I&nbsp;could shoot tethered.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, I&#8217;m not exactly what you&#8217;d call an early adopter, and I&#8217;ve only recently rediscovered a place in my heart for <a href="/2007/10/24/apples-sure-sign-me-up/" target="_blank">Apple based computing devices</a>.</p>


<p>That said, there was a lot of internal debate an struggle when it came time for me to upgrade from my Cingular 8525 HTC/Phone/PDA device.  Initially, I was convinced that I wanted the newest HTC <a href="http://www.wireless.att.com/cell-phone-service/cell-phone-details/?device=HTC+FUZE(TM)&amp;q_sku=sku3090226" target="_blank">the Fuze</a>, since it was a logical upgrade from what I had.  But there was just soooo much hype about the iPhone, I had to give it a fair shake.  Fortunately, my sister and brother-in-law each got one a few weeks before my wife and I were due to upgrade.  I got a real good chance to check them out.  After seeing the HUGE amount of apps, and overall support that existed for them, the choice was easy.  Sign me up, I&#8217;m a lemming..</p>


<p>I&#8217;ve had my iPhone for two and a half weeks, and I&#8217;ve made a lot of changes, tweaked a lot of configuration, and jailbroke the device.  The rest of this post will serve to document that for my own sake should I ever have to recover the device, but also to hopefully shed some light on why you might jailbreak your phone, and what apps a techie like me finds useful.</p>

<p>For the past few weeks there have been a rash of issues with our water supply lines here in our apartment complex.  We&rsquo;ve been without cold or hot water or both for hours at a time.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s culminated into our landlord deciding to basically gut our water lines and replace them.  So since last Friday we&rsquo;ve had folks coming in and tearing out large chunks of our drywall to reveal the plumbing, then the plumbers running new source lines along the outside wall and into each apartment.  Then water was turned off Monday night around 9PM.  The plumbers were coming in on Tuesday to finish hooking up the lines that had been run in parallel to the existing lines.  Well, the water remained off through Tuesday, and we&rsquo;d already forgone bathing for one day so we weren&rsquo;t looking forward to another day without running water.</p>

<p>That brings us to the image above.  We chose to check into the Ramada Inn that&rsquo;s directly next to our apartment complex.  They have this awesome koi pond/lagoon which the hotel surrounds, and as I was walking to the jacuzzi that night, it struck me how pretty the whole scene was a night.</p>

<p>So in an attempt to find a silver lining, I took some timed exposures of the lagoon at night.  I didn&rsquo;t quite get the effect I was looking for, but I think this is a cool shot none the less.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3362/3256305901_2c6444914c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>For those of you who may have missed it, this week one of my favorite new(ish) sitcoms <a href="http://chucktv.net/">Chuck</a> presented this episode in 3D.</p>

<p>I had evidently missed the marketing campaign that mentioned that it would be in 3D, probably cause I&rsquo;m not a big sports fan, and most of the hype was during the super bowl.  Consequently, I was caught with my pants down (as it were) with no 3D glasses with which to watch the show.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I always record Chuck on our cable company provided DVR (no fancy <a href="http://www.tivo.com/">Tivo</a> for us), so as soon as I realized it was being presented in 3D, I paused it, and began scrambling for a solution.</p>

<p>As it turns out, I have some gels used to modify the light coming from my photography flashes.  I also just happened to have two each of the red and blue gels (so my wife could enjoy the 3D-ness too).  A quick Google search later to determine which eye is which color, and the contraption you see before you was born.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3385/3256333889_97eb1b74d7.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Sadly though, it was still the same cheesy 3D effect that we&rsquo;re all used to.  And to make it worse, since it&rsquo;s a broadcast television show, they toned down the effect so those without glasses could still watch without their eyes hurting.  The overall result was less than awesome.  Never the less, the episode was good, and I can&rsquo;t complain.  Plus, I&rsquo;ve got a fun story to tell about how I made my own 3D glasses.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just received an email today from one of my contacts on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a>.  It was an invitation to join this new <a href="http://www.unyk.com/">UNYK</a> Address Book application which is apparently in beta.</p>

<p>I think I&rsquo;ve made it clear that I&rsquo;m a <a href="/2008/09/09/livin-on-the-web/">big fan</a> of anything which centralizes my information and allows me to access it through a web browser from anywhere, so I checked it out.</p>

<p>Overall, it looks quite promising.  It will harvest your existing contacts from several different locations (Yahoo!, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft Outlook, MSN, etc.) and consolidate them.  When you sign up you provide your personal and professional contact information, and this in turn keeps your contact record up to date for anyone who has you in their address book.  Their premise is that everyone will eventually use them to manage their contact information, and therefore your address book will always be &ldquo;automatically&rdquo; up to date, because all of your contacts will have updated their information with UNYK.</p>

<p>My first, and perhaps biggest problem with the service is that they don&rsquo;t provide an <a href="https://">https://</a> option.  So as I&rsquo;m entering all of this personal and professional data, as well as supplying my login credentials for these other services it&rsquo;s all going across the wire in plain text!</p>

<p>My second problem is that I&rsquo;m already using <a href="https://www.goosync.com/">GooSync</a> to store my contacts, and then synchronize them with my HTC phone, which is my life line as far as contact information is concerned.</p>

<p>There is also some considerable controversy regarding the fact that it will effectively &ldquo;spam&rdquo; the contacts that you do import inviting them to join UNYK as well.  This is no doubt how the email was sent to me.  I&rsquo;m less concerned about this than the previous two points however.</p>

<p>So in order for me to fully embrace this new UNYK solution, it&rsquo;ll have to get a &ldquo;secure&rdquo; presence, and either integrate (which they seem to already do quite well with several other services) with GooSync, or provide the same functionality (syncing with my HTC).</p>

<p>Seems like a cool idea, but it&rsquo;s not quite mature enough for me to dive in head first.  I&rsquo;ll keep an eye out though!</p>

<p>EDIT:
Since I was more than a little bit surprised that there was no secure access to login and supply my credential for other services, I did a little further digging.  UNYK insists in their <a href="http://www.unyk.com/en/Confidentiality">privacy policy</a> that they encrypt any &ldquo;sensitive data&rdquo; that goes across the wire.  Here it is directly from their site.</p>

<blockquote>How Secure Are Your Web Servers?    [ ^ ]
The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
To learn more about SSL, follow this link http://www.verisign.com/products-services/security-services/ssl/index.html.

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us.</blockquote>


<p>So, since it looked like they used a lot of Web 2.0 technologies I thought possibly they were doing some javascript magic to encrypt the stuff going across the wire, I did a little test with <a href="http://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a> to see what got sent.  I bit the bullet and imported my gmail contacts, and this was the result, with the password obscured by me, of course.</p>

<p>Clearly not secure.  I do have to admit however that I seem to have been wrong about the mobile sync, they do provide this, though I&rsquo;ll have no idea how well it works until they fix the security problem.</p>

      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I performed my search for the perfect <a href="/2008/09/25/photo-sharing-services/">photo sharing</a> solution, I fell in love with the Picasa desktop application.  I even discovered that there is a linux version.  However, as you&rsquo;d likely expect, it didn&rsquo;t really play nice as far as uploading photos to any photo sharing site other than Google&rsquo;s Picasa Web Albums.</p>

<p>On windows, there is a great solution called <a href="http://jerryong.com/blog/2008/06/picasa2flickr-uploads-your-picasa-photos-directly-to-flickr/">picasa2flickr</a> which passes the desired photo&rsquo;s to the windows <a href="http://www.flickr.com/tools/uploadr/">Flickr Uploader</a>.  Again, for obvious reasons, this doesn&rsquo;t work well on linux.</p>

<p>So, having determined that it wasn&rsquo;t worth my time to pursue trying to get Flickr uploads working from Picasa on Linux, I started evaluating many of the other native options on linux, such as digikam and fspot.  While these more easily uploaded to Flickr, and had open API&rsquo;s, none of them worked quite the way I wanted, so I abandoned my search for a good solution.</p>

<p>Then, on a whim I did a Google search just a couple hours after Andy O&#8217;Neill made a <a href="http://ultrahigh.org/2008/12/09/picflick-picasa-to-flickr-export-on-linux/">blog post</a> about a button he wrote to import photos to Flickr from the Linux version of Picasa, named picflick.</p>

<p>I eagerly (re)installed Picasa3 on my Gentoo box using a beta ebuild found <a href="http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=240406">here</a>.  Then installed his button.</p>

<p>After playing with it for a bit, I realized a few things didn&rsquo;t quite jive for me.</p>

<p>1) The script automatically resizes the image before uploading it to Flickr.  I prefer to upload all of my images at their original resolution, so this was a bit of a road block for me.</p>

<p>2) The script used a Perl module to upload to Flickr.  For the life of me, I couldn&rsquo;t seem to figure out how to get it authorized with my Flickr account to actually permit uploads.  I&rsquo;m sure if I spent a bit more time and read a few more manuals I could have gotten it right, but it didn&rsquo;t quite work &ldquo;out-of-the-box&rdquo; for me.</p>

<p>3) I&rsquo;d prefer to see the progress being made, rather than the beeps and tray notifications that Andy&rsquo;s script provided.</p>

<p>So, I stole the key part of his script, the part which translates Windows paths to *nix ones, and broke down the rest to simply pass the photos on to my preferred linux Flickr uploader, <a href="http://kflickr.sourceforge.net/wikka.php?wakka=Kflickr">KFlickr</a></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the contents of my script, including the win2native function written by Andy.</p>

<pre lang="bash" line="1">
#!/bin/bash

DEBUG=1     # debug to $LOG
LOG=/tmp/picflick.log
PICASA_WINE_DIR="$HOME/.google\/picasa\/3.0\/drive_c"  # Relative to $HOME
PICASA_WINE_DIR_NATIVE=`echo $PICASA_WINE_DIR |sed 's|\\\\||g'`

function debug() {
        if [ $DEBUG -eq 1 ]; then
                echo "$*" >> $LOG
        fi
}

# wine2native(): convert wine filename to native linux filenames
# Arguments: _name_ of variable which holds path
# Example: wine2native file  # not wine2native $file
function wine2native() {
        VAR=$1
        eval "VAL=\$$1"
        debug "Wine path: $VAL"
        # use '|' to delimit the paths
        VAL=`echo "$VAL" | \
                sed "s|C:|$PICASA_WINE_DIR|" | \
                sed 's|\\\\|/|g'`
        debug "Source file: $VAL"
        eval "$VAR=\$VAL"
}

# check we have the required dependencies
which kflickr > /dev/null || die "You need to install kflickr"

file=$1
wine2native file
DIR=`dirname "$file"`
EXT=${file##*.}
debug "START_UPLOAD"
for file in "$@"; do
        wine2native file
        KFLICKR="$KFLICKR $file"
done

debug "Launching kflickr with the following args $KFLICKR"
kflickr $KFLICKR

debug "Done"
</pre>


<p>Now when I click the &ldquo;Flickr&rdquo; button in Picasa, it brings up the KFlickr app with all the pictures I selected ready to upload.  Thanks for the inspiration, and code bits to make this work Andy, I was too lazy to actually figure out what was necessary to pull the image paths from Picasa and use them.</p>
