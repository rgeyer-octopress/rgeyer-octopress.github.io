    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Okay, if you thought the idea of a lightweight <a href=http://blog.ryangeyer.com/blog/2008/11/03/45l-duramax-saturn-sky/>sports car</a> with a big diesel v8 was exciting, consider this.</p>

<p>There is a kit car company out there named <a href="http://www.factoryfive.com/index.html">Factory Five</a> that makes various kit cars.  Cobra replicas, hot rods, and perhaps most interestingly, a &ldquo;build it yourself&rdquo; <a href="http://www.factoryfive.com/gtmhome.html">super car</a>.</p>

<p>Now the GTM super car kit is designed to be built mostly from 5th generation corvette parts, including the LS1 motor that&rsquo;s usually under the hood.  Now, we&rsquo;ve already established that the 4.5L duramax due in 2010 is designed to fit in the same envelop as the average LS series gas motor, and for the time being, I&rsquo;m going to stick to my assertion that the bellhousing bolt pattern will remain the same.  If all that turns out to be reality, this vehicle is practically designed to take the 4.5L duramax!  Sure, some intake and exhaust work will be necessary to point stuff out the other direction, however the &ldquo;inverse&rdquo; design of the intake an exhaust (exhaust ports and turbo live in the &ldquo;V&rdquo; of the motor, and intake is on the outside of the heads) might make this modification fairly easy.</p>

<p>Even at ~340hp, this thing should do 0-60 in around 3.5 seconds and put down a very low 11 second &frac14; mile!  The best part is, where my proposed Saturn Sky would be near the limits of traction and structural rigidity, this vehicle is DESIGNED for big power and huge stresses.  When the aftermarket catches up with the 4.5L, imagine how this thing would perform with over 500hp and 800-900ft/lbs torque!</p>

<p>Including the kit, the required C5 parts, and acquiring the new 4.5L duramax I imagine you could build one of these for under $70k.  Just imagine!  You&rsquo;d have something that out runs and out guns just about any super car ever built, and still knock down huge MPG numbers when you stay out of the loud pedal.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to start saving my pennies now.  ;&ndash;)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Okay, so I&rsquo;ve been a little bit out of the loop on the new Corvette ZR1 in spite of being a Motor Trend subscriber.</p>

<p>Bottom line, this is the fastest car the General has ever produced in any quantity for public consumption.  You can read all about Motor Trend&rsquo;s first drive <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/coupes/112_0810_2009_chevrolet_corvette_zr1_first_drive/index.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>However, my very favorite part is in the first paragraph of <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/coupes/112_0810_2009_chevrolet_corvette_zr1_first_drive/brakes_and_tires.html">this</a> page, where they reveal that every new ZR1 owner will be given the opportunity to attend a free high performance driving school!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s good to see Chevy taking a proactive approach to educating their customers, particularly when planting them behind the wheel of something as quick as the ZR1.  It&rsquo;s not exactly what I proposed <a href=http://blog.ryangeyer.com/blog/2008/03/11/check-out-my-new-ride/>here</a>, namely that I should be able to buy a car like the ZR1 if I was able to demonstrate my ability to handle it and my overall enthusiasm for the car, but it&rsquo;s certainly a step in the right direction.  Hey Chevy, how &lsquo;bout if I finish a course with Bob Bondurant &ldquo;with honors&rdquo; you offer me a discounted ZR1?  Yeah&hellip;  Right..</p>

    <id>http://blog.ryangeyer.com/blog/2008/03/11/check-out-my-new-ride</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5016/5449168507_97423bc6a9_o.jpg" width="436" height="275" alt="fordgt" /></p>

<p>No, I didn&rsquo;t actually buy a super car, but I think that I should be able to.  Allow me to elaborate.</p>

<p>I live in a rather affluent part of Southern California and nice (expensive) cars are not uncommon on our roads.  I spent just a couple hours recently at Shoreline (some bluffs just over the beach) and watched as every 3rd car that drove by was a Porshe.  Mostly boxters and cayman but none the less, where else in this world are porche&rsquo;s more common than hondas?  Here, you have to drive a Ferrari or Lamborghini to even begin to stand out.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s worse than that though.  I know of no less than 3 Ford GT&rsquo;s, 2 BMW M5&rsquo;s, 4-5 Astin Martin Vanquish, 2-3 Ferrari F430&rsquo;s, countless Bently GT&rsquo;s and Mercedes AMG&rsquo;s of all flavor, and last but not least one Maserati quattroporte which I see every day at work.  If I recall, when I read a magazine review of the Maserati the author felt comfortable saying that you may never see one of these vehicles in person, and here I am fighting for a parking spot with one.</p>

<p>Now those are just the cars that I&rsquo;ve observed on the road, god knows what is tucked away in garages and not driven but on the most holy of days to tootle on down to the country club.  And here, by my reckoning, is the worst part.  Most of the owners of the cars have NO CLUE how to drive, nor will they ever come close to exercising those cars to any where near the potential.  The worst offenders are the trophy wives who are driving around in their various Mercedes Benz AMG&rsquo;s.  There isn&rsquo;t one of them that drives more than 40 MPH at any time for any reason, very much including the freeway.  Either that, or they think they&rsquo;re an Andretti and drive dangerously fast in a straight line, and panic whenever they have to actually change trajectory.  Why their sugar daddies thought it was necessary to spend 30% more for the same car, but with a ton more power they&rsquo;ll never use, I can only guess.</p>

<p>Which brings me to the point of my rant.  I know, about time eh?!  I think that all manufacturers that make cars built for the enthusiast should have some sort of discount program.  Here&rsquo;s how it would work.</p>

<p>Perhaps only a couple weeks out of each year, you could walk in to your favorite uber car dealership, take a test drive, and chat with the salesperson.  Then before you go to sign the paperwork for your shiny new cruise missile you are required to prove your enthusiasm for the car.  How you ask?  By proving your mettle on a series of driving tests.</p>

<p>Picture this, you get behind the wheel of the $360k car that you&rsquo;d like to buy, and if you can wring it around the test track in less time than a certain predefined speed, demonstrate competence in controlling the car at, and beyond the limits of traction, and otherwise convince the manufacturer that you&rsquo;re willing and able to drive the car in the way it was designed, why it&rsquo;s yours for a mere fraction of the price!</p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t that what it&rsquo;s really about anyway?  These cars aren&rsquo;t built so that only real estate moguls and CEO&rsquo;s can own and drive them.  No!  They&rsquo;re designed to be driven FAST, on a track by a talented and appreciative driver.  So why not give your average Joe the ability to get into one of these vehicles, someone who would really cherish the privilege and (hopefully) have some respect for traffic laws and be able to control the vehicle on the street, someone like ME!</p>

<p>It might even cut down on the number of <a href=http://blog.ryangeyer.com/blog/2008/03/05/with-great-power-comes/>incompetent and unexperienced</a> drivers that get behind the wheel of these monsters.</p>

<p>Just a thought.  Manufacturers are you listening?  I&rsquo;ll take delivery of my Ford GT as soon as you realize how good this would be for business.  ;&ndash;)</p>
