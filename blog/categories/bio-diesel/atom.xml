    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Okay, if you thought the idea of a lightweight <a href="http://www.nslms.com/2008/11/03/45l-duramax-saturn-sky/">sports car</a> with a big diesel v8 was exciting, consider this.</p>

<p>There is a kit car company out there named <a href="http://www.factoryfive.com/index.html">Factory Five</a> that makes various kit cars.  Cobra replicas, hot rods, and perhaps most interestingly, a &ldquo;build it yourself&rdquo; <a href="http://www.factoryfive.com/gtmhome.html">super car</a>.</p>

<p>Now the GTM super car kit is designed to be built mostly from 5th generation corvette parts, including the LS1 motor that&rsquo;s usually under the hood.  Now, we&rsquo;ve already established that the 4.5L duramax due in 2010 is designed to fit in the same envelop as the average LS series gas motor, and for the time being, I&rsquo;m going to stick to my assertion that the bellhousing bolt pattern will remain the same.  If all that turns out to be reality, this vehicle is practically designed to take the 4.5L duramax!  Sure, some intake and exhaust work will be necessary to point stuff out the other direction, however the &ldquo;inverse&rdquo; design of the intake an exhaust (exhaust ports and turbo live in the &ldquo;V&rdquo; of the motor, and intake is on the outside of the heads) might make this modification fairly easy.</p>

<p>Even at ~340hp, this thing should do 0-60 in around 3.5 seconds and put down a very low 11 second &frac14; mile!  The best part is, where my proposed Saturn Sky would be near the limits of traction and structural rigidity, this vehicle is DESIGNED for big power and huge stresses.  When the aftermarket catches up with the 4.5L, imagine how this thing would perform with over 500hp and 800-900ft/lbs torque!</p>

<p>Including the kit, the required C5 parts, and acquiring the new 4.5L duramax I imagine you could build one of these for under $70k.  Just imagine!  You&rsquo;d have something that out runs and out guns just about any super car ever built, and still knock down huge MPG numbers when you stay out of the loud pedal.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to start saving my pennies now.  ;&ndash;)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since the first time I saw the Saturn Sky Roadster I fell in love with it.  Though, with my particular passion for diesel I&rsquo;d love to see one with a diesel motor.</p>

<p>Well, in 2010 GM is planning to release a <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2007/06/15/gm-announces-clean-diesel-v8-for-pickups-and-the-hummer-h2/">4.5L V8 Duramax.</a>  All of the marketing materials and announcements say that it&rsquo;s being designed to fit into the space of an LS small block, so pretty much anywhere a current GM v8 fits, this thing will too.  And it&rsquo;s currently being estimated at ~345hp!</p>

<p>This is good news, cause there are already several folks who have swapped LS1s and LS7s into Sky&rsquo;s and Solstices, and even some people making <a href="http://www.mallettcars.com/sky-conversion.htm">aftermarket kits</a>.</p>

<p>Now no one has said anything about if the 4.5 Duramax will have the same bolt pattern for the bellhousing as an LS, but it&rsquo;s probably a safe bet that it will.</p>

<p>A sky equipped this way should be able to out perform all but the most elite Corvette, and knock down 35+ MPG on the highway.  Yum!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I tend to have lots of ideas about project cars that I think are pretty cool.  The chances are I won&rsquo;t ever build any of them, but I figured I could start documenting them here just for fun, or on the odd chance that somebody reads my ideas and decides to build one of them.</p>

<p>So, for my first submission..</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been interested in the early to mid 70&rsquo;s datsun z for some time.  I even bought the &ldquo;jags-that-run&rdquo; book on converting one to a chevy 350 drivetrain.  I&rsquo;m still very interested owning one of these cars and doing an engine swap.  Here&rsquo;s what I think would be cool.</p>

<p>Take a 3.0L diesel, the modern common rail motor that is also dubbed &ldquo;Blutec&rdquo; when all of the emissions magic is done on it, out of a wrecked Mercedes and stuff it into a 240z.  Yeah, there are bigger badder diesel motors but they are heavier and would extend past the front axle of the z.  I&rsquo;m looking for a small, fast, but most importantly agile car.</p>

<p>Of course, the ideal transmission for this would be a true 6 speed manual, but no production vehicle with the 3.0L has one so getting the computer to cooperate, and mating up a manual may be more trouble than it&rsquo;s worth.  However, if you carried over the 7 speed automatic from the Benz and fashioned a paddle type shifter to activate the up and down shifts (should be possible since there is an &ldquo;automanual&rdquo; setting for the Benz that&rsquo;s clearly electronically triggered) it should still be a heck of a lotta fun in the twisties.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5051/5449777902_4025f2b249_o.jpg" width="283" height="423" alt="soybeans" class="alignleft" /></p>

<p>If you know me, or if you&rsquo;ve read some of my blog posts you probably know I&rsquo;m a big fan of diesel engines.  In particular I&rsquo;m quite fond of biodiesel.  I&rsquo;ve often preached that while OPEC continues to shaft us on the price of crude oil making gasoline and petroleum based diesel unreasonably expensive, biodiesel should decrease in price as the process used to produce it becomes more advanced and cost effective.</p>

<p>So, you can imagine my dismay when I drove by the local station which sells B99 expecting to see that it&rsquo;s price continued to hover around $3.30 per gallon, only to see that it was well over $4 per gallon.  What gives?!  Biodiesel was supposed to be the stable and reliable alternative to petroleum diesel, and here it is trumping the price of petroleum diesel by several cents per gallon.</p>

<p>Well, I forgot one important point.  Biodiesel is not just about the process required to produce it, there is also the feedstock required for the raw vegetable oil.  Turns out, <a href="http://www.autobloggreen.com/2007/08/22/rising-soybean-prices-cramp-biodiesel-producers-style/">the price of soybean oil</a> has increased dramatically this season.  This in turn has made biodiesel prices mirror petroleum diesel prices.</p>

<p>Now, I suppose this should have been an easily foreseeable problem based on the rules of supply and demand, but somehow I&rsquo;m still disappointed.  This is leaving me with a lot of doubt over what had previously seemed like a rock solid and obvious conclusion of buying diesel vehicles or converting my existing ones to diesel.  Where I had thought I&rsquo;d want to buy an Excursion, I think the wife is going to get her way and we&rsquo;re going to get an Acura MDX.  And where I had thought I&rsquo;d like to convert my Ford Explorer to some sort of diesel power plant, I&rsquo;m seriously considering modding my existing motor.  I don&rsquo;t suppose I&rsquo;ll get the same kind of fuel economy, or performance in either case but at least I can predict that the price of my fuel will steadily rise until I&rsquo;d rather walk than drive, rather than being at the mercy of a new fuel and a new industry.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m actually in no particular hurry to change anything, so I suppose I&rsquo;ll just wait to see how things pan out, and maybe I&rsquo;ll end up doing what I&rsquo;d initially planned.  But for now, consider me dejected and sad.</p>

    <link href="http://rgeyer-octopress.github.io/blog/2007/10/29/an-ob-nox-ious-truth/"/>
    <updated>2007-10-29T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://rgeyer-octopress.github.io/blog/2007/10/29/an-ob-nox-ious-truth</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="http://qwikrex.blogspot.com/2007/10/i-see-your-prius-and-raise-you.html">a recent post</a> I extolled the benefits of running even a large vehicle on biodiesel.  I focused mostly on the CO2 emissions, since that is the big buzz word, and the commonly known greenhouse gas.</p>

<p>I failed to discuss other emissions from such an engine and fuel combination.  I&rsquo;d like to talk about that now.</p>

<p>First, the good news.  For all emissions excepting NOx, biodiesel burns cleaner than petroleum diesel, and in many cases cleaner than gasoline.  You can see exactly how much so in <a href="http://www.biodiesel.org/pdf_files/fuelfactsheets/emissions.pdf">this summary</a> from the biodiesel board, which uses the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/OMS/models/analysis/biodsl/p02001.pdf">EPA&rsquo;s own research</a> as it&rsquo;s source.</p>

<p>Now, the bad news.  Burning biodiesel does not help mitigate it&rsquo;s high NOx emissions.  Actually, the research has yet to prove if biodiesel noticeably changes NOx emissions either for better or for worse as compared to petroleum diesel.  However, the fact remains that NOx emissions for a diesel engine is drastically higher than that of a similar output gasoline engine.</p>

<p>Why?  Well, I&rsquo;m not a scientist, and I can&rsquo;t present my own measurements and findings, but I can tell you is that my research has told me that NOx is more-or-less a byproduct of heat, and compression in the context of an internal combustion engine.  Unfortunately, I can&rsquo;t find any single resource to link you to that summarizes it elegantly and succinctly (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_oxide">except maybe this</a>), so you&rsquo;ll have to take me at my word, or  do the research yourself.</p>

<p>With that said, it becomes readily apparent why diesel engines, regardless of the fuel they are consuming, would have a higher NOx emission.  A diesel engine depends upon heat and compression to ignite the fuel, so it is by nature going to have higher NOx emissions.  Using biodiesel should not significantly change this, since it&rsquo;s still being ignited in the same way.</p>

<p>Now, not all is lost the Tier 2 Emissions standard that the EPA is imposing in 2009 addresses NOx emissions, and NOx is in-fact one of the primary reasons for the new standard.  In order to meet these standards manufacturers are using all sorts of different strategies.  Some of them are new and innovative like urea injection and &ldquo;self cleaning&rdquo; particulate filters.  Others have been around for years in gasoline vehicles, like exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and Catalytic Converters.  While these new emissions standards and equipment do pose a bit of a challenge for those manufacturing performance and aftermarket equipment for these vehicles, overall I think it&rsquo;s a step in the right direction.  Besides, many companies already have performance tuners and exhaust systems for the 6.7L Cummins diesel, and the 6.4L Ford Power Stroke, both of which meet the stringent new Tier 2 emissions standards.</p>
