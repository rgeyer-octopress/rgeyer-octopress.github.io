    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So there I was, minding my own business, driving the Lexus from point A to point B.  When I arrived at my destination, I turned off the ignition, and as it had done thousands of times before the power antenna began reeling back into the rear fender, but then it happened&hellip;  I heard a horrible CLUNK, then a persistent grinding sound that simply wouldn&rsquo;t go away.</p>

<p>I tried turning the ignition back on, hoping that the antenna might have only slipped on one tooth and cycling it would get everything back on track, but it was not to be.  With the antenna stuck just a little past half way erected, I removed the trunk interior panel that covers the power antenna motor, and disconnected the power.</p>

<p>On another, completely different occasion I was pulling out into traffic on a fairly busy four lane street.  The maneuver I was attempting was a left hand turn which requires crossing the two lanes which I can see fairly well, entering the oncoming traffic in the furthest two lanes, which are obscured by a neatly manicured and lanscaped island.</p>

<p>As you might imagine, this is usually a bit of a hail mary manuever and you want to do it as quickly as possible so that you have the chance to react if you happen to be pulling into traffic which you couldn&rsquo;t see.  I pulled across the first two lanes, reving to the redline in first gear, and quickly looking over my shoulder to check for traffic as I merge and briskly pull the shifter down into second gear.  Only, this time was&hellip; different&hellip;  I engaged second gear, but the shifter traveled WELL past the point it should have then felt limp and.. well.. broken!</p>

<p>After a minor panic attack, and some experimenting with shifting in and out of various gears, I discovered that the odd numbered gears (1,3,5) still engaged normally.  But, the even gears (2,4,Reverse) had this same &ldquo;limp&rdquo; feeling, though I was still able to engage them.</p>

<p>I drove the car for many, MANY months with both of these problems but I&rsquo;ve recently remedied both of them as part of my &ldquo;Late Model Restoration&rdquo; project.  Here&rsquo;s how.</p>

<h2>Power Antenna</h2>


<p>This one was easy, replacing the power antenna mast is both inexpensive and easy.  I bought a replacement mast on eBay for under $20, and replaced it in about an hour.  It would have taken less time if I had paid closer attention to the directions and installed the outside decorative nut in the right order.  Ohh well!</p>

</p>




<div style="clear:both;">
<h2>Limp Shifter</h2>
As it turns out, I wasn't the first person to experience this.  There were a handful of guys with manual ES300's over on <a href="http://www.clublexus.com/forums/es300-and-es330/478465-shift-cable-bushing-transmission-terminal-replacement-firstgen-92-93-a.html">ClubLexus</a> who'd had a similar experience.

After reading through their experiences, I decided that my symptoms were caused by a damaged shifter bushing, and I ordered up the Speed Source solid bushings.  While I was ordering parts for the rest of the Late Model Restoration, I started to second guess my diagnosis and went ahead with ordering the replacement cable as well.

Let me tell you, removing and installing the cable is quite a painful experience.  It requires the removal of two grommets, one on the inside of the car against the firewall, and one inside the engine compartment against the firewall.  They're both held on by only two bolts, but they are in extraordinarily difficult to access places.  I literally spend an entire day on this project alone.

What's worse, I probably didn't need to replace the cable at all.  As it turns out, the shifter bushing was seriously damaged, and was actually a bit more of a heart shape than the round machined shape it should have been.
</div>

<p>The result, however, is well worth the effort.  The shifter feels perfect now.  Very positive tactile feedback, I know when I&rsquo;ve engaged a gear.  It&rsquo;s easily &ldquo;better than new&rdquo; with the solid bushings and the factory fresh cable.  While replacing the cable may not have been expensive (it&rsquo;s a > $200 part) and not immediately necessary it&rsquo;s worth the peace of mind knowing that it&rsquo;s new and I&rsquo;ve got at least another 18 years before I have to worry about it again.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more of the Late Model Restoration, the suspension is next, and here&rsquo;s a little teaser!

    <id>http://rgeyer-octopress.github.io/blog/2010/04/08/caddy-hibernating-for-the-summer</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Time for a quick update on the Cadillac.  Last time you read about the caddy, I shared my <a href="http://www.nslms.com/2010/03/11/i-dub-thee-bionic-caddy/">discovery</a> that it had the rather desirable "Switch Pitch" variation of the Turbo 400 transmission.  As such, I decided it was best to have it examined before I put the car back together.  I took it over to Alphonso's Transmission in Goleta, hoping that it just needed to be cleaned up, and perhaps have a few smaller parts repaired or replaced.  Unfortunately, this was not to be.  As he started dismantling the transmission he very quickly discovered that the main forward band was broken, the forward drum was burnt, and the 2/3 clutch pack was nearly worn down to the steel.  So, the only real choice at that point was to go ahead and rebuild the transmission completely.</p>




<p>Now, I'm totally stoked that the trans was rebuilt, and Alphonso has been building these things for longer than I've been alive, and did a spectacular job.  I also have a brand new variable pitch torque converter.  All for the (quite reasonable) price of $1100.  Problem is, I only had $600 to spend, which I was hoping would be enough to get the trans repaired, and buy a few small parts I needed to get the car back together.  Instead, I had to borrow the rest of the money from our savings.  This means for the next 3 months I'll be paying our savings back from the caddy's fund, at which point we're expecting our new son Tate!  So as you can imagine I'm not going to have the time, nor the presence of mind to be working on the caddy for a while after that, and I won't have any money to spend on it until then.</p>




<p>As a result, I'm trying to do little things on the caddy until Tate is born that don't cost me anything.  So I'm tearing the motor down a bit further, and trying to clean it up.  I popped the timing cover off to check the timing chain/gears.  Turns out this is yet another part which is going to need replaced!  The chain is SUPER loose, like enough that I almost feel like I could cause it to skip a tooth with the slack.  Also, apparently in the late 60's it was all the rage to install and market "silent" timing gears.  I had the same get-up on my 1967 Ford Thunderbird.  It's essentially a hard plastic cam gear for the timing set, which is supposed to reduce the normal timing set noise.  I seriously don't get this, since the other noises that these machines make more than drown out any noise that the timing set might make.  But, I digress..  The point is that the hard plastic cam gear is also showing signs of stress, with hairline cracks forming down the middle of each tooth.  It'll definitely have to be replaced.</p>




<p>I had hoped that I could just throw the engine back together without buying a whole lot more parts for it, and as such had sorta planned not to inspect it too thoroughly.  With events unfolding as they have, I think I am going to go ahead and check all the rest of the clearances and see what else (if anything) may need replaced.  Depending on how things turn out, I may or may not stick with this motor.  As I've stated before, the 429 is a low production motor and the parts are surprisingly hard to find, as well as expensive.  If I find that it needs more than bearings (a cam, or some machine work for instance) I may simply sell this motor to someone who's working on a numbers matching restoration and buy a 472/500 to put in it's place.  The good news is that my 429 is in generally good shape, and certainly does not need a lot of work, so it should have some reasonable value to someone who's looking for original parts.</p>




<p>So that's where we stand.  I had hoped to have her all back together and be driving 'er by now, but it looks like I'm going to be taking my time even a bit more, and being even a bit more methodical.  I can't wait to experience that finely crafted and tuned transmission! ;-)</p>

    <link href="http://rgeyer-octopress.github.io/blog/2010/03/11/i-dub-thee-bionic-caddy/"/>
    <updated>2010-03-11T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://rgeyer-octopress.github.io/blog/2010/03/11/i-dub-thee-bionic-caddy</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve provided an update about the progress of on the Caddy. &nbsp;Mostly because things have been slow due to a busy work and family schedule. &nbsp;Here&#39;s the rundown of what I have gotten done though.</p>


<p>I have rebuilt the carb, and realized that a broken vacuum pot on the carb was actually only used to crack the throttle open a bit and increase the idle RPM when the A/C was running. &nbsp;Since the A/C system is not holding pressure, and looks like it hasn&#39;t in many many years, I went ahead and removed this &quot;extra&quot; part. &nbsp;Hopefully this&#39;ll fix the hesitation problem that I detected on the few short drives I took. &nbsp;</p>


<p><!--more--></p>


<p>Now, when I first got the car, I immediately noticed that there wasn&#39;t any sort of linkage that I could see for the tranny kickdown. &nbsp;So while I&#39;ve been staring at the service manual to get my carb back together properly, I&#39;ve also been trying to figure out how the heck this thing is supposed to get a kickdown signal from the throttle. &nbsp;Turns out there is a switch which is supposed to be mounted on the intake manifold, near the carb which actually sends a +12v signal to the transmission for kickdown!</p>


<p>Even more interesting than that, the transmission in this thing is at least as rare as the engine. &nbsp;I&#39;ve got a THM400 with &quot;Switch Pitch&quot;, which was only offered in the Caddy for like 3 years. &nbsp;Basically the torque converter has two stall settings, one around 1000RPM and another around 3200RPM. &nbsp;It switches between the two with another +12v signal (also sent by the switch which I don&#39;t have) which causes the angle of the blades in the converter to change. &nbsp;So, that means two things.</p>


<p>First, instead of just throwing everything back together and hoping the trans &quot;just works&quot; I&#39;m actually going to take the time to yank it out and have it gone over to make sure it&#39;ll work well for me. &nbsp;No sense it blowing this thing up since it&#39;s a stout and apparently rather desirable piece! &nbsp;I&#39;m hoping to have it yanked out this weekend, and over to&nbsp;Alphonso&#39;s Transmission by Monday.</p>


<p>Second, because I don&#39;t have the original switch to operate the &quot;Switch Pitch&quot; mode and kickdown I&#39;ve got to either find one (fat chance) or devise my own. &nbsp;Currently, my plan is to mount up a TPS (Throttle Position Sensor) to the carb and feed that signal to an&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/categories.php?c=103" target="_blank">Arduino Microprocessor</a>&nbsp;which will send the +12v signals to the trans for both the switch pitch, and trans kickdown. &nbsp;There is actually a guy who built a controller for the switch pitch part of the trans back in the mid 80&#39;s, and I&#39;ve actually been in touch with him. &nbsp;His solution uses vacuum, the brake light, and timers to operate just the pitch change of the torque converter. &nbsp;Then a mechanical switch for the transmission kickdown. &nbsp;His name is Bruce Roe (<a href="mailto:bcroe@juno.com?subject=Switch%20Pitch%20Controller%20-%20via%20Ryan%20J.%20Geyer%20(www.nslms.com)">bcroe@juno.com</a>) and I&#39;ve been in touch with him to get some feedback on how his device works. &nbsp;He&#39;s been very helpful and encouraging, I can only hope my device is as effective as his.</p>


<p>So, with that I&#39;ve decided I&#39;m going to nickname my Caddy &quot;Bionic Caddy&quot; in honor of the fact that &quot;we have the technology, we can make it better&quot;. &nbsp;It&#39;s especially fitting since I&#39;m going to put a <a href="http://www.mp3car.com">CarPC</a>&nbsp;in it, and hopefully put a <a href="http://www.bgsoflex.com/megasquirt.html">Megasquirt EFI</a> on it one day. &nbsp;Also, it abbreviates nicely to a personalized license plate *BIONCAD*. &nbsp;Should be good fun.</p>


<p>While my simple project of identifying (and fixing) a mysterious &quot;clunk&quot; has sorta exploded into a much bigger project of getting the engine back together and building a controller for the transmission, I still hope to get it done reasonably soon and keep the complexity to a minimum. &nbsp;Stay tuned for updates!</p>

    <id>http://rgeyer-octopress.github.io/blog/2010/02/02/mystery-solved</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rgeyer/4326832460/" title="Culprit by qwikrex, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4017/4326832460_9568d6b705.jpg" width="500" height="335" alt="Culprit" class="alignright" /></a>Well there she is, the source of my clunk!  And, the way it's sitting in there explains why the engine wouldn't turn past TDC as well since that thing woulda been right in the way.  So far as I can tell it's a small(ish) washer that got folded in half.  You can see a few more shots of it over in my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rgeyer/sets/72157623338455858/">Flickr set</a>.  What remains a bit of a mystery is how it got there.  I'm guessing it entered through the intake, and it's possible it was sitting on top of the throttle blades of the carb.  Tough to say if it was there when I got it, or if I managed to drop it there while I was working.</p>




<p>All in all, there doesn't seem to be much (maybe any?) damage from the whole debacle.  The you can see both the cylinder wall and the combustion chamber for that cylinder, and they both appear unharmed!<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rgeyer/4326095801/" title="No Worse for Wear by qwikrex, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4045/4326095801_b54c204303_m.jpg" width="240" height="161" alt="No Worse for Wear" class="alignright" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rgeyer/4326829224/" title="Combustion Chamber by qwikrex, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2764/4326829224_6ff8018ba7_m.jpg" width="240" height="161" alt="Combustion Chamber" class="alignright" /></a>  Remember back when I described that one of the cylinders had a <a href="http://www.nslms.com/2010/01/11/the-surprises-continue/">spark plug that had 0 gap</a> and appeared damaged?  Yup, you guessed it, that plug came from this cylinder.  Makes sense, all of the steel for the cylinder wall, piston, and head are harder than the washer would have been, and the spark plug would have been a softer metal as well.  Soft enough to sustain some damage from that thing flinging around in the cylinder.  This also explains why it seemed fairly inconsistent, when that cylinder was not on it's power stroke the washer would have happily just moved up and down the cylinder wall in place.  Then when there was ignition in that cylinder, the pressure probably sent it flying around!</p>




<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rgeyer/4326081891/" title="Until Next Time by qwikrex, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4029/4326081891_aab1acec33_m.jpg" width="161" height="240" alt="Until Next Time" class="alignright" /></a>I also made another discovery while I was working.  The bolt on the front of the crank that I'd been using to turn the motor over, doesn't actually belong there!  The balancer is simply pressed onto the crank with no big bolt to hold it on like you find on many other motors.  It's becoming more and more apparent to me that one or more people who've worked on this thing haven't been terribly methodical, and clearly didn't have a service manual to reference.  In spite of that, the motor appears to be fairly low mileage and it quite good condition.</p>




<p>The plan now is to do some more inspection and measure things to see if they match the tolerances set out in the service manual.  If everything checks out, I think I may just put her all back together and run her.  Going to keep my fingers crossed that everything is as tight as it appears to be so I can get some miles outta this thing!</p>

    <link href="http://rgeyer-octopress.github.io/blog/2010/02/01/engine-autopsy/"/>
    <updated>2010-02-01T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://rgeyer-octopress.github.io/blog/2010/02/01/engine-autopsy</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rgeyer/4323196620/" title="Engine Removal by qwikrex, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4034/4323196620_ce4b21e310.jpg" width="500" height="335" alt="Cadillac 429 on Hoist" class="aligncenter" /></a></p>

<p>I got the engine out of the Caddy this weekend!  The first lesson I learned is that I should have either removed all of the pulleys and water pump, or removed the front clip of the car.  I had a TON of trouble getting the motor out past the radiator core support!  In fact, I wound up yanking the water pump off while the motor was in limbo just to buy myself a few more inches of clearance.</p>




<p>Once it was finally out, and safely on an engine stand, I started my investigation and search for the source of my "clunk" sound.<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rgeyer/4323193542/" title="Dipstick Shrapnel"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2545/4323193542_7bb11526c5_m.jpg" alt="Dipstick Shrapnel" class="alignleft"/></a> First, I yanked the intake manifold and the cover for the lifter valley.  I found nothing particularly interesting there, certainly no obvious foreign object which would account for the noise I've been hearing.  So, I tipped the thing over and started pulling out oil pan bolts and upon removing the pan I was greeted with what you see on the left.<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rgeyer/4322455459/" title="Sabotage! by qwikrex, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4322455459_c40cc405ce_m.jpg" width="240" height="161" alt="Sabotage!" class="alignright"/></a>  Now I expected to find chunks of oil dipstick in the engine, since I'd previously <a href="http://www.nslms.com/2010/01/24/no-more-guesswork/">reported that the dipstick appeared broken</a>.  What I did not expect though was that the dipstick would be so completely mismatched!  The photo on the right shows the engraving of "Ford" on the dipstick.  Apparently the previous owner just decided to toss whatever dipstick he had handy into the tube, and call it a day.</p>




<p>Not knowing what the original design of the Cadillac dipstick is, I can't be sure, but it feels like this is a bit of a poor design.<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rgeyer/4323182094/" title="Dipstick Interference by qwikrex, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2688/4323182094_5c5a2992c2_m.jpg" width="240" height="161" alt="Dipstick Interference" class="alignleft" /></a>  If the dipstick is straight, and goes down the dipstick tube straight, it appears as though it'll run right smack dab into the rotating assembly as you can see on the left.</p>




<p>As satisfied as I was with my discovery, I realized pretty quickly that this couldn't be the source of the "clunk" I was chasing down.  The bits of dipstick were simply too small and light weight to account for the sound I was experiencing.  Plus, when I pulled the oil pan off, all of the bits were sitting right inside the oil pickup which means they were likely "stuck" there by suction from the oil pump any time the engine was running.  So I kept inspecting, looking for any other foreign object big enough to account for what I'd heard.</p>




<p>After several minutes of looking around with a flashlight, I figured I'd start turning the motor and seeing if anything seemed out of place.  I pulled all the plugs so that compression wasn't an issue, and started turning the motor over.  It turned nice and easy until it neared top dead center (TDC), where it halted and I couldn't seem to continue turning it no matter how much (reasonable) force I applied.  Perplexed, I went ahead and turned the engine the opposite direction.  Again it turned smoothly until I had reached a full rotation in the opposite direction and it again stopped dead in it's tracks.  Hrrmnnn..</p>




<p>So that's the current mystery, the engine doesn't seem to turn over freely any more now that I've pulled it out, and turned it upside down!  I knew it couldn't be piston to valve contact, since it's a hydraulic lifter motor and almost all of the lifters had lost pressure allowing all the valves to stay closed.  So, more likely it's piston to head contact.  I didn't notice any obvious signs of bent connecting rods or loose connecting rod caps so the cause isn't readily apparent.  Next step will be to yank the heads off and see if there is any obvious damage which might indicate which cylinder is causing the problem.  The title to this post may be a bit premature, but I don't suspect I'm going to find anything minor.  Stay tuned as I continue to tear it down to find the problem!</p>
