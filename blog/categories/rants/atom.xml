    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rgeyer/4369302088/" title="Tate Maternity by qwikrex, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4013/4369302088_65d899576b_m.jpg" width="240" height="166" alt="Tate Maternity" class="alignright" /></a>Now let it be said that I am not skinny, I haven't been skinny for years.  Heck I haven't weight 100lbs since puberty struck and I'm ok with that.  Thankfully I am happy with my body and I see room for improvement.  I am thrilled to say that the hubs is sweet on my current figure and has been a fan of my body for the entirety of our marriage.  I just hate how the topic of weight and size keeps coming up at the oddest times, I mean I'm at work and someone will ask me how my weight is going.  Um, I am in my third trimester in my second pregnancy, why the heck is it your business what my weight is?  Why is it now that I am carrying and supporting another life it's ok for you to ask and then have an opinion about the fact that I am actually still down from the weight I was when I found out I was pregnant?!?  I'm not sure if this hormonal woman is ok with either response to this piece of information.  People may tell me, 'Good for you!' :gives person blank stare: Are you trying to break it to me that you thought I was fat?  Are you just not a fan of women gaining weight to sustain healthy life?  Am I ready too much 'jelly' for you?  Last time I looked in the mirror I looked good, darn good.  Last time I walked down the street to get somewhere I get smiles, from men and women appreciating that my form is to sustain another life.  Smiles because I'm happy and confident in who and what I am which is obvious in the way I hold myself.</p>




<p>The other answer which irritates me is 'Are you eating enough?  I mean you have seen a doctor and they have said you aren't hurting yourself or your child, right?', really?  You think that I would take as much time to take care of myself but when I'm pregnant I wouldn't go see a doctor regularly to be sure that both my unborn child and I are ok?  You would think that I would harm my baby or myself in some way?  I love my children, both my toddler and my unborn son.  They are a huge chunk of my everything.  I have seen a doctor as soon as they would see me for my current condition and have been reassured over and over that all is well and wonderful with both of us. </p>




<p>I know I gained some weight in my last pregnancy, and according to my OB that was healthy and good for both of us as my son's growth was perfect.  I also know that I go out of my way to eat healthy daily and eat multiple meals and snacks daily in this pregnancy and my son has already showed signs of being a big strong child that will be born in a couple of months.  Was there ever concern about my lack of weight gain?  Sure, but I went to a specialist and he checked my youngest son's growth and development and he is right on track for a above average fetus.  When we got that green light from him both my OB and I sighed a sigh of relief and have continued to see that this pregnancy has progressed well.</p>




<p>Now my goal for this pregnancy was to have a 'skinny' pregnancy, meaning I was going to be back down to my wedding day weight and then get pregnant, then gain a beautiful amount of weight and be that really cute pregnant lady.  Due to complications of life and interesting health circumstances this didn't work out.  When I found out I was pregnant I was over the moon, and I still am.  I got over the fact that I wouldn't be able to shop at a trendy maternity store in town and just figured I'd be a bit curvier, like I was last time.  I embraced it and moved on.  I'm ok with it, but Lordy why do I have to explain where I'm at so often with, at times, complete strangers.   I know I'm a friendly person, I am generally cool with sharing but can't I have a few off limit areas when I'm exhausted trying to be all I can be for my husband and my baby boys?</p>




<p>I have never regretted not weighing 100lbs or less since being an adult, I don't look good under 120lbs.  I know, I have tried it out and I'm all skin and bones and my body resists it.  When I say resists it I ache from head to toe, I don't have much energy.  My body just feels better at a higher weight.  Weight is simply a taboo topic and when you are a person that has studied the number on the scale critically and wondered why you can't seem to keep your weight lower like all the girls at school do.  It means that you aren't thinking about your body, your gentics, your shape.  My genetics, my shape is not conducive to weight 120 or less, just isn't and I'm ok with it.</p>




<p>Now if I could get everyone else on board or to just leave the weight topic alone for bit life would be good.  Because some days I don't want to have a debate on my weight, it's my booty and I love it.  You don't?  Then don't look at it. :-P</p>

    <link href="http://rgeyer-octopress.github.io/blog/2009/12/03/navigating-domain-registration-a-tale-of-a-near-miss/"/>
    <updated>2009-12-03T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://rgeyer-octopress.github.io/blog/2009/12/03/navigating-domain-registration-a-tale-of-a-near-miss</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The story you are about to read is true, not even the names have been changed so as to fully implicate the accused.</p>

<p>First, a teensy bit of background.  I conduct a lot of transactions online, and do most of my business electronically.  I own three of my own domains, and manage a fourth for a friend, as well as hosting all of them on my own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server">VPS</a>.  As such I feel I&rsquo;ve become pretty attuned to possible scams, phishing attempts, and other ne'er-do-wells.  That is, until last week.</p>

<p>See, when I needed to register a new domain and have it hosted, I went with the &ldquo;all in one&rdquo; offering with the hosting company I was using before I switched to my VPS.  This was super convenient, as they handled registering the domain for me, and set me up with one year of hosting a website and email for that domain for one year.  Great, one stop shopping!  That was nearly one year ago, and the domain is due for renewal in December.</p>

<p>So, when I received an email from a domain registrar I did not recognize suggesting that I renew my domain I assumed that it was the domain registrar that my hosting company used to register the domain on my behalf.  I happily followed the link and renewed my domain with that registrar for two more years.  I did find it odd that I didn&rsquo;t have to supply any user credentials or other identification, but I just assumed they&rsquo;d use some of the personal information I provided to compare against the WHOIS or something.  Besides, what do they care if someone else pays to renew a domain, even if it doesn&rsquo;t belong to them, right?</p>

<p>Well, some days later I received another email, from what appeared to be a separate entity than the domain registrar I renewed with.  This email requested that I authorize a domain name transfer to them.  Hmmmn.. Wait, I thought I renewed, not transferred.  Something is wrong here..</p>

<p>I proceeded to do a few quick Google searches on the domain registrar that I renewed with, and the name of the registrar which was apparently requesting a domain transfer.  Turns out they&rsquo;re all part of the same organization based out of Canada, and all I read was experiences of shady business practices and situations of domains which were either lost, or trapped in limbo!  Some keywords for you to search on in order to read what I read about.  No bueno!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=domain+registry+of+america+scam">domain registry of america scam</a>
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=domain+registry+of+america+brandon+gray">domain registry of america brandon gray</a>
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=namejuice.com&ie=utf-8">namejuice.com</a></p>

<p>Great, so now I realize I&rsquo;ve given my personal details to some unscrupulous individuals and they&rsquo;ve charged me $50 for two years of domain registration which I&rsquo;ll likely never actually receive from them.  Fortunately, the domain transfer request turned out to be suspicious enough to catch my attention and make me thing twice before proceeding!  At least my domain name is safe (I hope).</p>

<p>Next steps?  I call my bank, and file a chargeback for the $50 charge, and have them cancel the Visa bank card I used to place the order.  Now I get to be on the look out for odd or fraudulent charges on my account, yay me!  Tomorrow I&rsquo;m going to try to actually renew and transfer my domain to <a href="http://www.register.com">Register.com</a> where I manage my other domains.</p>

<p>So, here are the lessons I&rsquo;ve learned and some sage advice you might benefit from.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Whenever possible, register your domain name yourself with a reputable domain registrar.  Something like;
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.register.com">Register.com</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.networksolutions.com">Network Solutions</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.godaddy.com">Go Daddy</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If you do happen to let some entity register a domain on your behalf, know who that registrar is.  You can use the <a href="http://www.whois.net/">WHOIS domain services</a> to learn what registrar "owns" your domain.</li>
  <li>When renewing or registering a domain, make sure not to do so by clicking on links from emails, instead go to the registered web address for the domain registrar identified in the previous bullet point</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Of late the hubs and I have been trying to do everything at once.  Weaning our son, and encouraging him to sleep in his own bed.  Both of us have been crazy busy with our jobs.  We have been searching for a new home to rent.  I have been attempting to get in better shape so as to be able to keep up with a baby boy and keep my health in check to the best of my abilities.  We keep trying to keep our home clean, which seems to only last for a moment after cleaning.  Trying to really take the time to catch up with each other and making sure both of us are really getting the down time that we need.  It simply has been crazy.</p>

<p>Now we are recovering from a long weekend of attempting to do all of it, and do it well.  My son is finally sleeping for a good stretch.  It is peaceful in my home right now.</p>

<p>I just saw a LOVELY home that I want to live in but it is simply too small for our needs.  The home we looked at last night is simply bigger than we need.  I am so bummed that we can&rsquo;t make the charming little place work.  Did I mention that my husband is chomping at the bit when it comes to the larger home?  <em>sigh</em></p>

<p>I am just trying to figure out how to make everything fit in our lives and make sure nothing is being neglected.  To be a good woman, a good wife, a good mother, a good daughter, a good sister&hellip;it is a hell of a lot to juggle.  I am learning but dear lord, every time I think I have everything under control something new pops up.  I can&rsquo;t wait till the home search is done.</p>

    <link href="http://rgeyer-octopress.github.io/blog/2009/09/03/my-tmi-post/"/>
    <updated>2009-09-03T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://rgeyer-octopress.github.io/blog/2009/09/03/my-tmi-post</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Warning:  This post may be a bit, um, private or sensitive but it must be said.</p>

<p>Time and time again I see the commercials for Viagra and Levitra and they have their spokesmen saying, puzzled that one medical condition or another has effected their performance in the bedroom.</p>

<p>EVERY SINGLE TIME I yell at the television questioning if that is for real.  I mean really?  You didn&rsquo;t know that things that effect your blood flow to your entire body would effect your erectile function.  For serious!!???</p>

<p>Mkay, I have no medical education.  I only have the education taking care of my grandfather after heart attacks and open heart surgery.  The education that life as a dental assistant gives you.  Which by no means gives me the medical authority of anything.  And yet I know that diabetes, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure can effect erectile function.  I realize in turn that the medication to help with these conditions also can effect erectile function.  WHY ON GOD&rsquo;s GREEN EARTH DON&rsquo;T MOST OF OUR SOCIETY NOT KNOW THIS TOO???!!!???</p>

<p>You need blood to flow to this body part to be able to function to do blank.  Why wouldn&rsquo;t cholesterol which slowly clogs blood vessels effect this function?  Why wouldn&rsquo;t high blood pressure effect this function?  Why wouldn&rsquo;t diabetes which effects so many other aspects of your ability to function not effect erectile function?  I wish instead of using these medications men took the time to take care of themselves to do the best to prevent these issues to the best of their ability.</p>

<p>Too much to ask, I know.  I hear more and more that men are dying from preventable illnesses.  If only they had gone to a doctor and had taken action when a health concern was in the warning or beginning stages.  Yet so many fight it every step of the way.  They are too busy.  They are able to &lsquo;man up&rsquo; through what ever ailment they are coping with.  Sigh.  Yet if they can&rsquo;t get it up they run to their doctor and ask for a pill.</p>

<p>Not often do you hear about a man who can&rsquo;t get it up and they demand that their physician to do a battery of tests to make sure everything is ok.  Make sure that this isn&rsquo;t a precursor to another, bigger, possibly more serious health concern.</p>

<p>What am I getting at?  Guys if you take care of yourself.  If you see a doctor regularly and bring up you concerns that you may have quickly, maybe you won&rsquo;t need the mighty blue pill.  Maybe you will be healthy enough for sex and be able to enjoy a great deal of other  aspects of life.</p>

<p>Common sense people, please use it.</p>

    <link href="http://rgeyer-octopress.github.io/blog/2009/03/08/tethered-shooting-professional-chimping/"/>
    <updated>2009-03-08T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://rgeyer-octopress.github.io/blog/2009/03/08/tethered-shooting-professional-chimping</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Okay, first..&nbsp; This post/rant was inspired by a few tweets from Chase Jarvis.&nbsp; That said, I'm not throwing stones, or trying to start a fight.&nbsp; The topic just got me thinking and I&nbsp;wanted to share my train of thought.&nbsp; Chase, and any other professional who shots tethered, I'm actually jealous.&nbsp; I&nbsp;wish I&nbsp;could shoot tethered.</p>


<p>Read more after the break...<!--more--></p>


<p>So, the gist of the tweet(s) was about shooting tethered with the Nikon D3x and Aperture on a MacBook.&nbsp; At first I&nbsp;thought &quot;curse you Chase and your justifiable budget for fancy gear cause you're a professional&quot;.&nbsp; But then I&nbsp;thought, isn't this just the professional expensive version of chimping?&nbsp; If you've not heard of chimping, wikipedia has the best description I've seen <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimping">here</a>.</p>


<p>See, since I&nbsp;got my dSLR I've been reading a lot around photography communities, forums, and the like.&nbsp; In that time, I've been able to gather that &quot;chimping&quot;&nbsp;is considered a weakness, and that &quot;real professionals&quot; don't do it.&nbsp; I don't really subscribe to this mentality, afterall the manufacturers put the LCD&nbsp;on the back for a reason right?</p>


<p>I've recently shut off the automatic review of photos on my Nikon D80, for a number of reasons.&nbsp; For one, it's distracting to have the LCD&nbsp;glowing into your eye when you're shooting a lot of shots in a dark situation, like in our living room at night capturing something our son is doing.&nbsp; Also, the dials on the camera change function when the LCD&nbsp;is on to move back and forth between photographs, and the info that's overlaid.&nbsp; So if you shoot a shot, and keep the viewfinder to your eye, but try to change the exposure it's ineffective and you just scroll through the pictures.</p>


<p>That said, when I'm doing anything other than &quot;snap shots&quot; I&nbsp;find myself pushing the play button to see the shot I&nbsp;just took.&nbsp; Needless to say I'd gladly shoot tethered.&nbsp; At the moment I&nbsp;have nothing but Windows and Linux based systems, and I&nbsp;haven't commited to software for a RAW&nbsp;workflow or other tools that would allow me to shoot tethered, but I&nbsp;can assure you when/if I&nbsp;have all the tools necessary I'll probably do it too.</p>


<p>So, I&nbsp;say to the critics of chimping...&nbsp; Is tethered shooting really just an expensive version of chimping?&nbsp; Is it &quot;OK&quot;&nbsp;for a professional to shoot tethered, and if so why is it any different than us mere mortals looking at the LCD&nbsp;on the back of our camera?&nbsp; I submit that you are just jealous, like I&nbsp;am so you fabricate reasons that this practice is &quot;bad&quot;&nbsp;and makes you &quot;weak&quot;.</p>


<p>Comments?</p>
