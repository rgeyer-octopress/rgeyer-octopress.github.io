<p><a href="/images/255790697_f288115839_m.jpg"><img src="/images/255790697_f288115839_m.jpg" alt="" title="255790697_f288115839_m" width="240" height="215" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1082" /></a>When I was little livin&#8217; on the edge has changed so much over the years.  When I was a child, living on the edge meant walking on the highest point of a swing set and climbing to scary heights of a giant tree.  It meant playing in a vacant apartment to escape the heat, because I knew I would be in huge trouble taking my baby sister to the pool without my parent&rsquo;s permission.</p>

<p>When I was a teen it meant talking back to my mom, staying out late, and that one time I drove my friend&rsquo;s car with her trying to cheer me on before I got my license.  It was when I tried to see just how long I could function well with little to no sleep, oh college days.  Yeah, I was that awesome culinary student that worked in a bakery, so there were days I would be up at 3:30am and wouldn&rsquo;t get to bed the following day till 1pm due to work, school and my dreamy boyfriend.</p>

<p>When I was in my twenties it meant having crazy make out sessions with my husband everywhere, yeah I&rsquo;m a wild child, crazy newlywed me and yeah we grossed out our sisters on numerous occasions.  Or the fantastic time we went to a wine festival and followed up that afternoon of drinking with going home and drinking more wine and eating of fine cheeses and fruit.  Wild and crazy I tell ya!!</p>

<p>Now as a mother, living on the edge is a whole new world.  When I had one child, living on the edge was coming home late for his evening nursing session or letting him run around naked for more than half an hour.  Now living on the edge is changing my toddler on the floor and spacing on closing the gate to keep my baby away from the dirty diaper I have removed.  It&rsquo;s also when I hear an pause in the constant chatter from both boys and don&rsquo;t immediately jump up and check on what mischief they may be getting into with each other, you know like tearing apart their play room to the point beyond recognition.  Like right now, I&rsquo;m so living on the edge as I have not followed my baby crawling to the office where my dreamy, adorable, and thank goodness patient husband is busy working.  How things have changed.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about how often moms &lsquo;get&rsquo; to talk about poop.  First we talk about poop all of the time when we are pregnant, or the lack there of due to all the iron we are taking.  Then as we get closer to delivery then we are amazed with the amount of &lsquo;cleansing&rsquo; our body does.</p>

<p>When we have our beautiful baby then we are very concerned about the number of wet and dirty diapers.  You even beg your child when jaundiced to just poop a few more times that particular day.  You even proudly show the chart you&rsquo;ve been using to record all the naps and wet and dirty diapers the first time you go and see the pediatrician.</p>

<p>Then there are the conversations about poop, wet diapers, and frequency that you have with other moms.  When you child starts to eat solids, you start to panic due to the length of time between poopy diapers.  Then you conversation includes, what foods help your nearly toothless wonder to poop.  How about what foods to avoid when you are still having to change poopy diapers.  I also love the hysterical moments that I&rsquo;ve dealt with and didn&rsquo;t warn my husband about the effect the blue rice crispy treat had on my toddler&rsquo;s dirty diaper.</p>

<p>I would have never thought that I would have long in depth conversations about my sons bowel movements.  I do now have those conversations with more people than I ever dreamed of. Heck, now that I&rsquo;m trying to convince my eldest son to potty train, we talk about pee and poop every single diaper change.  Heck, now my son brings up the topic of poop to me on a daily basis.  I have a feeling I will continue to talk about poop for the rest of my life, personally I blame Dr. Oz.  He started it.  I mean who else but he encouraged us to look in to toilet after we pooped.  Yep, I blame him.  :-P</p>

You would think that being the only girl in the house that I would not be surprised with the grunting that goes on here.  I mean my husband has been known to nod at me and grunt and I would know that means, &ldquo;Why yes I would love another beer sweetie.&rdquo; and that a long grunt with eyes closed while at the dinner table and eating a dinner I made means, &ldquo;Oh my goodness honey, you out did yourself.  The cabernet savignion bouquet paired with the fillet mignion and the red wine reduction sauce is outstanding with your roasted garlic mashed potatoes.&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I learned quickly what my first son was trying to communicate with grunts and hand gestures when he was an infant.  He was much more focused on learning and mastering physical milestones, he was all about stacking blocks and figuring out how to use his legos before one.</p>

<p>Now, with my second son I am often in awe over how well he communicates already as an infant.  He is a great mimic and sounds like he is using words.  No, this isn&rsquo;t the delusion of a proud mom.  I have had other people confirm that he is trying to imitate words being said and he is pretty darn good at it.  My son has his clear and concise way of communicating when he wants to eat, play, and crawl.  I officially can&rsquo;t say he didn&rsquo;t tell me when he needs or wants something.</p>

<p>My eldest loves learning new words and regularly amazes me.  Of late he loves to say, &ldquo;I suppose.&rdquo;, and uses the perfect inflection when saying it.  He uses other fantastic phrases and only likes to use them when he understands their meaning and asks you to say it so he can get the pronunciation down pat then put his own spin on it.  My favorite is when someone is trying to talk about something and they don&rsquo;t understand a word he uses, he then says it perfectly in an exasperated tone that says, &lsquo;duh.&rsquo;.  Yes my children are a wee bit snobby.</p>

<p>So I have the caveman, short hand communication down pat with my guys and the one that is the biggest fan of communicating with grunts is the big one, you know, my husband and their father.  Who would have guessed?</p>

<p>When Amazon announced it&rsquo;s Authoritative DNS service, cheekily named Route 53 a few things popped into my head immediately.  First, this should be a much easier way to get the effects of Dynamic DNS which we were currently leveraging <a href="http://www.dnsmadeeasy.com/">DNS Made Easy</a> for.  Secondly, I wonder how much of a performance boost using it might provide.</p>

<p>We all have them, some are easier than other but they all have their own level of awkwardness no matter how many times we rehearse what we are going to say.</p>

<p>The hard conversations I have had are numerous from the awkward &ldquo;I have a crush on you.  Do you like me?&rdquo; to &ldquo;Do you want to get married?&rdquo; to &ldquo;What kind of discipline do you want use for our future children?&rdquo;.  Now that I&rsquo;m starting to have those hard conversations with our children, you would think that that would be far off into the future but no.  Now that my three year old is becoming aware of the differences in people be it size or color or hair types I realized we need to start making sure he knows his background is and understands that we all make up a beautiful rainbow that is the world.</p>

<p>Our first conversation went over better than I expected and left me in awe over the mind of a three year old.  It went something like this:</p>

<p>M: &ldquo;Q, did you know that you are black, Mexican, Native American, and white?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Q: &ldquo;I black?  I white?  I Mexican like Dora?  Wow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>M:  &ldquo;Yes you are all of those things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Q:  &ldquo;I black!  I change color some day?!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is the point where I walked out of the room hysterically laughing, we are talking doubled over, couldn&rsquo;t breathe, tears streaming down my face.  Have I mentioned how awesome my kids are?  Because they are AWESOME!</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s me, I am the odd woman out in my home.  I have two boys and my husband and often it feels like an all boy house as I cuddle in my favorite spot on the couch and attempt to read something girly.  I&rsquo;m happy to have my boys, they are awesome, I wouldn&rsquo;t trade either of them for a girl ever.  I find that all the boys get kind of quiet as my husband works on something techie, car related, or yard work related in their presence.</p>

<p>Now that my 3 year old is becoming aware of everything and wants to talk about everything he likes to remind me that I&rsquo;m different.  I&rsquo;m shorter than my husband, by over a foot, I have curly hair he has straight hair, etc.  His newest epiphany?   Penises.  Good times, let me tell you.</p>

<p>We had the following conversation:</p>

<p>3yr old: &ldquo;I has a pianus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Me:  &ldquo;Yes you do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>3yr old:  &ldquo;Baby brother has a pianus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Me: &ldquo;Yes he does.&rdquo;</p>

<p>3yr old: &ldquo;Daddy has a pianus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Me:  &ldquo;Yes he does, good job son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>3yr old:  &ldquo;You has a pianus?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Me:  &ldquo;No I do not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>3yr old: Looks at me shocked and with pity, &ldquo;You not has a pianus mommy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Me:  &ldquo;No son, I don&rsquo;t have a penis.  I&rsquo;m a girl and girls don&rsquo;t have penises.&rdquo;</p>

<p>3yr old:  Furrows brows and gives me a concerned look, &ldquo;Mommy not has a pianus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Me:  &ldquo;Yes son, I do not have a penis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>3yr old:  Smiles, &ldquo;But Daddy and baby brother and me has a pianus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Me:  &ldquo;Right again son.  Good job.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure my son will ever look at me the same way again now knowing that not only do I have lactating breasts but I don&rsquo;t have a penis.  He really seemed to be so concerned that I didn&rsquo;t have such an important body part.  I laughed hysterically after he left the room.  I think his epiphanies will often leave me cracking up even when it means I am in fact the odd woman out.</p>

<p>Last week, I told you how you can use Amazon&rsquo;s Identity and Access Management (IAM) offering to better secure the services and tools you use to manage your AWS environment with <a href="/2011/03/28/create-aws-ser…ounts-with-iam/">service accounts</a>.  Well on February 14th IAM got that much sweeter when they opened up the ability for IAM users to login to the AWS Console.</p>

You know those moments when you are ready for a change, something big that will put some pep in your step?  I have an afro.  It has taken years to get it this long.  My boys know nothing but me with braids or wearing my afro big.  Every now and again I consider chopping it short like it was on my wedding day or for fun to straighten my hair for a minute or dying my hair.  When I consider this I wonder how my boys would respond, if they would recognize me as their mom or if they would be upset by such a drastic change.</p>

<p>There are days that I wonder about plastic surgery, you know whether or not to get the mommy make over when the boys are grown.  I&rsquo;m talking tummy tuck, breast lift, and implants&hellip;right now there is no way that is happening.  Other than the brutal recovery while trying to take care of my kids I also wonder what kind of example I would be setting.  I&rsquo;m queen of love yourself for yourself, embrace who you are so it feels like I would be hypocritical to change myself via plastic surgery.  I wonder what that would say to my boys about what is important about the qualities of a woman.</p>

<p>Now I don&rsquo;t judge nor encourage others to judge that may want to do cosmetic surgery.  I am amazed by the actual surgeries, fancinated with the implants and techniques and amazed by the end results.  I just don&rsquo;t know if I personally can do it and still be me.</p>

<p>I remember just going and doing things for myself and now I have to think of the impact that my decisions may have on my baby boys.  Things sure got complicated.</p>

<p>I was told on numerous occasions by the veterans of motherhood that you&rsquo;d be amazed with the strange things you will, not may, but <em>will</em> say.  It&rsquo;s completely true.  I was amazed by the truth of it when i had my first child, but the things that have come out of my mouth since having my second, dear lord!  They are so out there that even I find myself repeating them out of shock and amazement.</p>

<blockquote>Son, don&#8217;t headbutt me.</blockquote>




<blockquote>Stop sniffing your brother&#8217;s butt!&#8221;</blockquote>




<blockquote>Seriously son, look where you&#8217;re running.  You will run into a wall like you did last time if you don&#8217;t look ahead!</blockquote>




<blockquote>Whatever your name is, stop it!</blockquote>


<p>I regularly consider sharing these comical statements with family and other times I wonder if I&rsquo;m the first one having to say some of these things.  I know I&rsquo;m not but dear lord I would love to meet some moms out there having to yell things like;</p>

<blockquote>It&#8217;s not nice to drool all over your brother.  I just put him in that outfit.</blockquote>


<p>Or the ever embarrassing;</p>

<blockquote>Please don&#8217;t bite my butt!  That&#8217;s gross!</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been making use of Amazon Web Services (AWS) quite a lot lately.  In order to really enjoy the benefits of Cloud Computing (automation, agility, etc) I&rsquo;ve had to use a number of tools to interact with AWS on my behalf.</p>

<p>All of these external tools ask for the same thing to enable them to make AWS API calls, your AWS Access Key ID, and your AWS Secret Access Key.  Common practice is usually to just hand over the main set of these credentials, but there is a better (more secure) way, using Amazon Identity and Access Management (IAM).</p>
