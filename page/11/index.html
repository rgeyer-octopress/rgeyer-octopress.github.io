  <div class="entry-content"><p>Did I get your attention?  ;&ndash;)  Breast, boobs, ta-tas, they are a very popular topic in my household.  Not for the reason you may think, but rather because of breastfeeding.  I have been successful in nursing my child for nearly 20 months.  I have attempted to wean him for nearly 7 months.  I wish I was joking.</p>

<p>When I first began to nurse my son it was a struggle.  I learned that my failed induction, twenty hours of labor and my long recovery from my c/s slowed my milk from coming in.  I was forced to <em>gasp</em>, supplement with formula for the first couple of days home.  I was encouraged to drink beer, eat oatmeal, drink lots and lots of fluids and eat eat eat.  I was just terrified that I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to provide the food my son needed.</p>

<p>I knew there are worse things that could happen.  I knew that formula is great and it has come a long way.  But I got my natural birth taken away, I didn&rsquo;t even get to have a vaginal birth hopped up on an epidural.  So breastfeeding was one of those things that I was determined to have.</p>

<p>When the pediatrician checked our son out when he was nearly a week old and told me that he was gaining quite nicely and it was obvious my milk had finally come in.  Then he said those wonderous words, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to supplement with formula anymore.&rdquo;  I was beaming and grinning from ear to ear.  I think I even made my husband repeat it to me a couple times on the way home.</p>

<p>Because my son broke out into a few pretty wide spread rashes prior to six months I was told to start removing certain things from my diet to see if it helped him.  Months later we were told that we could start adding solids to his diet but with certain provisions.  Due to the fact that I have allergies and asthma, the pediatrician told us to be cautious with dairy, eggs, berries, nuts, citrus, and strawberries.  Because we were so nervous about possible reactions I was making his food at home.</p>

<p>My son would play with the food, maybe eat a few bites but was focused on nursing.  It was like it was his favorite past time.  I felt like a failure and a success at the same time.</p>

<p>I took my son to his nine month appointment and was told to stick to the restrictions I was given but to add fat every chance I had to the solids my son ate as he was a little on the light side.  So olive oil was added to all veggies with fresh herbs.</p>

<p>We survived to his 12 month appointment and we were given the green light to start adding foods from the restricted list slowly.  I was told that he was still light and not gaining ideally but he had made a small improvement in gaining.  I was encouraged to wean him asap.</p>

<p>My son loved most foods we gave him but he was very suspicious of cows milk. I kept attempting to start slowly taking nursing sessions out and he would protest.  Most that talked to me told me to wean him cold turkey or would tell me to keep doing a good job nursing him.  My neurologist even told me to just stop nursing my son, then looked at my son and said, &ldquo;Never mind.  He is just too cute to deny.&rdquo;  Thanks.</p>

<p>So after many attempts to stop cold turkey I am now down to nursing my son only during the evening and at night.  He is not interested in a bottle, a sippy cup or pacifier at night, he only wants me.</p>

<p>I still dream of weaning my son but I just don&rsquo;t have the stamina to go through night after night of the screaming and knowing that all I have to do is let him cuddle with me and nurse.  I keep trying to distract.  I keep trying to start a new routine.  My husband has tried to be the one to put our son down for naps and for the night, he is successful for some naps and has yet to be successful for putting him down for the night.</p>

<p>We will keep trying, we won&rsquo;t give up.  We have learned a lot.  The biggest lesson we have learned is our child is as stubborn as his parents.  We don&rsquo;t give in often, he is told what he can and cannot do and those are consistent rules that are upheld all of the time.  This is the one area that neither of us seem to be able to stick to as both of us are desperate for sleep every night so that we can preform well the following day.</p>

<p>One last time, BOOBIES!  LOL!  Hey, I have to keep laughing. :&ndash;)</p>

<p>Once you have one child often family and friends wonder when and if you will have another.  In the hubs and my case, most know that we want another child.  The debate soon after having our son, literally a couple hours after delivering our son, of who would take care of him the next time we would be in L&amp;D.   The other question that came up for the entire first year of our son's life was when we would start trying, I had hoped to wait for 4-5yrs. while my husband wanted our children closer in age 2-3yrs apart.  We had plans.</p>




<p>In my morning stupor I am starting to question our plans.  I definitely want a sibling for my son, I would love to give him one soon but I'm not sure how soon that will be.  I think I am on an information overload.  I have read so much about secondary infertility.  Too many articles about parents who got pregnant easily with their first and yet they need assistance from a reproductive endocrinologist to get pregnant with their second child.  Now I am freaking out.  What if we are one of those couples?!?  We got pregnant the first time very easily.  Are we doomed to have a long arduous road to try to give our son a sibling?  Will we be able to provide a sibling for our child?  Is now the right time to try to conceive?  Should we wait a bit more?</p>




<p>This is my own personal freak out.  Husband this is why I wake up at 6am on a Saturday morning.  I know I over think EVERYTHING but I am at a loss as to what to do and to plan for right now.  Sometimes I am such a girl sometimes, ewww.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you&rsquo;re reading this, it means that the DNS records have replicated and Random Musings is now fully hosted on my shiny <a href="http://www.linode.com/">Linode VPS</a>!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been steadily growing out of my previous hosting solution over on <a href="http://www.hostmysite.com/">Host My Site</a>.  All things being equal they&rsquo;ve served me very well, but running Wordpress started to demand more memory than they&rsquo;d allocate for a shared hosting customer.  Then there&rsquo;s the limited functionality of the PHP stack which I was starting to run up against quite regularly.</p>

<p>I have to say I&rsquo;m SUPER pleased with <a href="http://www.linode.com">Linode</a> so far.  I signed up for it on the 21st, and by today I&rsquo;ve got it completely setup hosting web and email for three domains, with another on the way.  I was worried that it would cost me money, but when I account for the other hosting accounts I&rsquo;ll be able to close I wind up money ahead.  Sweet!</p>

<p>Hopefully this change will be seamless to ya&rsquo;ll, might notice an increase in speed.  Let me know if you see anything &ldquo;odd&rdquo;.  :&ndash;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I completed my first full day in a long time at work Wednesday and was greeted at the door by my precious son who felt a little warm.  I figured that my very warm apartment was the issue, and just decided to keep a close eye on him.  After being home for a few hours it had cooled down quite a bit in our home and yet DS was still very warm.  We took his temperature and he was indeed feverish.  We immediately gave him tylenol and together, the hubs and I kept a close eye on him.</p>

<p>He felt feverish again around 11 and we gave him more medicine.  I was too antsy to sleep so I watched his temperature as both the hubs slept for a couple hours, he dropped so I figured it was safe to sleep.  I slept for maybe three or four hours and was woken up by baby boy rooting to nurse, he was on FIRE.  I took his temperature and it was way to high for comfort.</p>

<p>We ran him to the hospital where they gave him more medication in hopes to break his fever and then we waited with the medical staff as they kept checking on him in hopes that the fever would break.  Everything else about our son looked fine, he was even playful during our visit to the ER in the early morning hours.  After an hour and a half we were discharged and told to call the pediatrician asap to see if he could be seen in the next 24 hours.</p>

<p>We came home and both my husband and son passed out from exhaustion.  I on the other hand had to go to work so as soon as I could get a way I got dressed and ran to the office.  I worked for a couple hours and got a few things done but headed out pretty early as I knew I wasn&rsquo;t going to be worth much as the day went on.  My boss was incredibly understandable and sweet about my circumstances.  I went home in hopes to find a happy baby without a fever and found a happy feverish baby.  We went to see his pediatrician and the Dr. let us know that we needed to stick to medicating him regularly until the fever breaks but overall our son was doing ok minus the fever.  He gave us a few options as to why he had the fever and if things didn&rsquo;t improve we are to see him again quite soon.</p>

<p>That night my husband took up the bulk of taking our son&rsquo;s temperature and medicating him as he knew I was exhausted and knows sleep is very important for my health.  Sadly we had to stay on top of medicating him as his fever was still in full force.</p>

<p>The following morning we noticed we could have breaks between doses and could even drop one of the medications.  He was still feverish but he wasn&rsquo;t hitting 103* F anymore and we were thrilled.  By the afternoon he seemed to have improved greatly and we haven&rsquo;t had to give him any medication since.</p>

<p>My son has been doing quite well today, no fever in sight.  He has been playful, sweet, energetic, and testing his boundaries.  In short he has been a happy toddler.  Oh, the roller coaster of emotions that is parenthood, it has been interesting.  I have learned that my husband and I move quickly and precisely as a team.  We both know when the other has hit their limit and the one that can keep going is quick to take on a little more responsibility when it is needed.  I was given a reminder that I have much to be thankful for and to appreciate how much we have been blessed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rgeyer/3781867519/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2625/3781867519_b067ff0486_m.jpg" class="alignright" alt="Forte F36 20x8.5 +15mm Offset on 1967 Cadillac Deville Sedan Hardtop" /></a>

So, one of the first purchases I made for the Cadillac was a set of new wheels.  I knew the Cadillac needed tires, since the rears were showing obvious sings of dryness and cracking.  I also knew I didn't want to "waste" money on buying tires for the stock wheel size when I knew I wanted to replace the wheels.  Well, the passenger rear tire gave out after less than a week parked in the cul-de-sac.  I saved my pennies and ordered up the tires at the beginning of the week, and they arrived at <a href="http://www.bigbranddirect.com/">Big Brand Tire</a> late Thursday night.</p>




<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rgeyer/3782678752/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3458/3782678752_3d8a375456_m.jpg" class="alignleft" alt="Cracked Rear Tire" /></a>

The wheel is a Forte F36 that's 20x8.5 with a +15mm Offset and the 5x5 bolt pattern of the caddy purchased from <a href="http://myworld.ebay.com/ebaymotors/gearworksmfg/">Gear Works</a> on eBay.  The tires are Kumho Ecsta SPT 245/40R20 front and rear, purchased from <a href="http://www.tirerack.com">Tire Rack</a>.  I had wanted to keep the wheel size down and keep some sidewall on the tire.  Lots of people are installing 22" and 24" wheels on these cars, and I think it's a little excessive.  In fact, even the 20" installed leaves a little less sidewall than I'd ideally prefer, but it's too late now!</p>




<p>I've generally had excellent service from <a href="http://www.bigbranddirect.com/">Big Brand Tire</a>, but they were having a rough day when they were installing my tires it seems.  First, when I went to pick up the wheels with the tires mounted on them, they had neglected to gather together the <a href="http://www.tirerack.com">Tire Rack</a> invoice, Kumho warranty documentation, and the plastic center caps for the wheels.  Then, only moments after getting them home I get a call.  Turns out they'd accidentally installed the wrong tires on the car!  They'd put someone elses Michelin 255/35R20's on my wheels.  I hadn't noticed because the tread pattern and size were VERY close to the tire I had ordered, and as I said I've always had good service and expected that they'd done it right.  Ahh well, I'll still be using them, but it was a bit of a comedy of errors.  (Mental note 255/35R20's are a decent fit!)</p>




<p>Installing this wheel/tire combination was fairly difficult, especially in the rear.  I had to jack the car WAY up and let the rear axle droop completely in order to slide the old wheel/tire combo out and the new ones back in.  The deep wheel wells are a great design feature of the Cadillac but makes it tough to wrestle a tire up into them.  The other surprise came when I was putting on the very first wheel on the rear.  I put the new wheel on, and it didn't seem to ever sit flush against the brake drum.  I forged ahead with putting the nuts on the studs, hoping that the weight of the wheel was what was preventing me from pressing it up flush against the brake drum.  After snugging all the lugs it didn't seem to rock anymore, but I still wasn't confident.  It wasn't until I got to the other side that I realized the problem.  There is a small bolt that bolts into the hub through the brake drum.  The back of the wheel is machined flat, where as the stock wheel has a relief in it allowing for this bolt to be installed.  I simply removed this bolt on both sides.  Not sure if it's "necessary" but I doubt that the added strength of a 1/4" bolt on a surface held together by all 5 wheel lugs is going to make a difference.</p>




<p><p>You may recall from <a href="http://www.nslms.com/2009/06/04/67-caddy-day-1-triage/">Day 1 Triage</a> that the brakes seem to have failed on the Caddy.  So while installing the wheels and tires, I also attempted to bleed the brake system.  This too, was a bit of a comedy of errors.  I have the correct tools for loosening the bleed screws, however even these don&rsquo;t have the clearance necessary to really get a good &ldquo;bite&rdquo; on them.  I managed to open them up, and do some bleeding, but my bleeding tool also wasn&rsquo;t great.  If anything I think I may have introduced more air into the system.  I&rsquo;ll have to re-try again later, probably with a custom built tool to loosen the bleed screws and a better bleeding tool.<p /></p>

<p></p><p>After bleeding the brakes, and getting the new wheel/tire combo on I wanted to see if I had any brake left at all.  I was convinced that the brake system had a serious failure because the cadillac has an automatic system for releasing the emergency/parking brake when the car is put into gear.  This mechanism depends upon the brake being depressed, and uses a pressure sensor in the system to determine if it is &ldquo;safe&rdquo; to release the parking brake.  After the car was delivered, the parking brake was never released when the car was put into gear.  After my botched bleeding attempt, there was some trepidation, but I manually released the parking brake with a small lever under the dash.  The brakes held!  I then took it for a brief victory drive.</p></p>

<p><p>Of course, to get the car started in the first place, I had to grab the battery from the X.  Seems there is a draw in the caddy which slowly drains the battery when it is not driven.  Worse still, in swapping the battery in, I noticed that the positive (+) cable is routed through the radiator support, and is likely to get worn through and short to ground.  Going to have to re-route that post haste!  Mark up two more things for the todo list.  :&ndash;)</p></p>

<p><p>The drive was good, it is missing a bit at full throttle.  Also when you floor it there is a hesitation before the engine responds.  Some carburetor and timing attention is in order.  Taking it out for a spin also reminded me that I still need to replace the water pump and get the cooling system working.  But, progress none-the-less!</p></p>

<p><p>Ohh and, if there was any doubt that this is a big car, here&rsquo;s the proof.  4 fullsize tires in the trunk!

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I guess it is only right to introduce myself.  I am a twenty something year old woman that has been happily married for seven years.  We have been blessed with remarkable baby boy.  I am a multicultural person that enjoys and embraces all that I am made up of.  I have had many an up hill battle and I believe it has aided in who I am and so far I love who that is.
I believe my entries on this will be a bit different than by incredible husband&rsquo;s as I am not an engineer, so only a little will be about photography, cars, and I have little to nothing to talk about computers.  Oh and because I am a girl.  LOL!   So to those that may be just discovering my rantings enjoy the ride.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2659/3756315543_22ba3d06b5.jpg" alt="Just some eye candy" class="alignright"/> Okay, so this is almost two months overdue, but I wanted to share an observation and thought process I had courtesy of one of the professional photographers I follow on <a href="http://twitter.com/rjgeyer">Twitter</a>; <a href="http://twitter.com/AcmePhoto">AcmePhoto</a>.</p>

<p>The tweet was something along the lines of &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got plenty of fireworks photos, so I left the SLR behind&rdquo;.  This was in reference to the July 4th fireworks display this year.</p>

<p>My first reaction was; Sweet, he doesn&rsquo;t have to lug around the SLR and a tripod.  He&rsquo;s probably got some great shots, and now he can just enjoy the time with his family.  But then, I thought;  Well shoot, that&rsquo;s kinda a bummer.  Why doesn&rsquo;t an opportunity like that excite him? Has he become jaded?</p>

<p>See, I&rsquo;m an amateur, and I&rsquo;ve only had my DSLR for just over a year.  Every photo opportunity excites me, and everything is new and undiscovered for me.  I haven&rsquo;t taken any fireworks shots on the last two July the 4th&rsquo;s and I&rsquo;m really looking forward to the chance to shoot some great fireworks shots.  So for me, I think about EVERYTHING as a &ldquo;cool shot&rdquo; and I&rsquo;m constantly thinking &ldquo;boy I wish I could take a great picture of that&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Now for the average professional, I presume this sort of almost hysteria about taking photos goes away, and you get a much more focused and methodical approach to capturing great images.  But, is there a cost?  At what point do you tip the scales toward the mundane from the constant conscious (or subconscious) excitement and inspiration for making great images? Or do you, but you&rsquo;re just more contained and rational about it?</p>

<p>Now don&rsquo;t get me wrong, <a href="http://twitter.com/AcmePhoto">AcmePhoto</a> makes great stuff, and I don&rsquo;t for a second categorize him as uninspired or uninteresting.  I&rsquo;m just trying to wrap my head around how the creative process changes as you become more comfortable with your tools, and hone your artistic eye.  For me it&rsquo;s all emotional, visceral and as a result my work isn&rsquo;t always the quality I&rsquo;m really after, and things don&rsquo;t turn out the way I envision them.  On the other hand, professionals seem to be able to execute with an almost cold indifference, but the result is never the less artistic and excellent.  Is this just what we see on the exterior?  Are they actually just as giddy inside, but have learned to control it, and not wear that on their sleeves?</p>

<p>So professional photogs, for you, when did you transition from a hyper child excited by the prospect of any image, to someone who can execute in a repeatable and genuinely artistic way?  Perhaps that&rsquo;s the real difference between an amateur and a professional?</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Okay, so as you may already know I'm a big fan of any software solution that does what I need in a portable and platform agnostic way, particularly if it does it "<a href="http://www.nslms.com/category/cloud-computing/">in the cloud</a>".</p>


<p style="text-align: left;">What you may not know, is that I'm addicted to <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> and I've been going through desktop based Twitter clients faster than <a href="http://www.nslms.com/category/1967-cadillac-sedan-deville/">my Cadillac</a> beer bongs fuel!  My affair with desktop clients started with <a href="http://tweetdeck.com/beta/">TweetDeck</a>, since it's used by a lot of my friends on Twitter and it seemed to be a front runner.  The problem is that it's in beta, and it's a bit buggy still.  Worse yet, it doesn't run on my linux box.  In fact, no decent Twitter client does work on my linux box.  I've also tried <a href="http://www.twhirl.org/">Twhirl</a>, and <a href="https://destroytwitter.com/">DestroyTwitter</a>.  Both of which lack all the features TweetDeck has, and none of which work "quite right" on my linux box.</p>


<p style="text-align: left;">And, as if to add insult to injury the company I work for has recently been acquired by a MUCH bigger company which is imposing a lot of new restrictions to the use of our desktop computers.  Meaning I'll likely not be able to install a Twitter desktop app on my computer in about a month.</p>


<p style="text-align: left;">Enter <a href="http://www.twittergadget.com/">TwitterGadget</a>, pictured above.  It's an iGoogle gadget so it runs in my browser, on windows or linux, without installing!  And it's quite featureful too! It has built in URL shortening which is one of the features I miss most from other desktop apps.  The one feature I hope to be included soon is <a href="http://tweetshrink.com/">TweetShrink</a> integration, but I'll live without it.</p>


<p style="text-align: left;">Hopefully I won't have to change Twitter clients for a while now!  :-)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3396/3613325576_22b72bc80c.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="335" /></p>

<p>As you can see, when I bought the Deville it lacked a lock cylinder for opening the trunk!  Yesterday I set out to try to get it open, and possibly rig something up to be able to continue to do so until I can do a proper repair.</p>

<p>Though I do now have a factory service manual, I couldn&rsquo;t find any detail on the trunk latch anywhere.  I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s in there, but I was too impatient to keep leafing through the PDF, and just went to work at it.</p>

<p>In my ignorance to the operation of the latch, I assumed I would have to remove the rear seat and either crawl through the space into the trunk, or poke at the mechanism with a stick.  After getting the rear seat out, I discovered a few interesting things.</p>

<p>First, there is a bit of a dried puddle of rusty water on the passenger side.  I didn&rsquo;t shoot a picture of it, but I&rsquo;ll be sure to capture it next time.  The rust doesn&rsquo;t come as a huge surprise to me as I was aware of some small holes around the bottom of the rear window where rust has completely consumed the metal.  However, I didn&rsquo;t expect the volume of water that has apparently entered the vehicle.  I suspect there is a good chance that there is more serious damage to the roof, and window opening in the back.  We&rsquo;ll discover more as we go along.</p>

<p>The next realization was that there is NO WAY I was going to crawl into the trunk from the back seat.  In fact, I&rsquo;m not sure any adult, or even a child old enough to understand the task could fit.  Worse still, my assumption that there would be some failsafe lever or latch in the trunk was faulty.  I know in more modern vehicles this was added due to some legislation or similar relating to people being locked in trunks.</p>

<p>So, I got my flashlight, and started peering into the keyhole to see if I could figure it out.  Lo and behold!  It appears as though I can just stick a nice flat head screwdriver in there to open it up.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3385/3613327956_9a046665e3.jpg" alt="" width="335" height="500" /></p>

<p>I had hoped to find something interesting in the trunk, but it was the usual.  Some &ldquo;spare&rdquo; parts for the car and a cardboard box, probably used to lay on while working on the car.  Pretty typical, nothing really exciting that might give some hint of the glamorous history of the car.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3565/3612491255_07abbaf0b7.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="335" /></p>

<p>What I did find however is something that surprised me.  I knew that Cadillac has had a mechanism for their trunks which gracefully pull it closed, so you aren&rsquo;t required to slam the hood, but had no idea that this was standard or optional equipment on a car this old!  I noticed that the latch was kinda strange, and seemed to &ldquo;float&rdquo;, and had a small contact for a switch.  Further investigation showed some sort of hydraulic cylinder which probably does most of the work, which is pictured below.  I&rsquo;ll have to do some research on this to see if it was standard or optional.  The best part, it even still works!</p>

<p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3230/3613332778_c2ec87a3f0.jpg" alt="" width="335" height="500" /></p>

<p>More interestingly still, there appeared to be some sort of solenoid attached to the latch, which you can sorta see on the right in the picture above where the screwdriver is in the lock.  It has wires going to it and everything.  This leads me to believe that there may be some electronic release for the trunk, but I have no clue where the switch for it is!</p>

<p>All in all, a successful hunting expedition, and rather informative, and my helper seemed to approve!</p>

<p>She arrived today at around 10:50 am.  I used <a href="http://www.theexpressauto.com/">Express Auto Transport</a> by the way, this being my first experience with auto transport, it went quite seamlessly and I&rsquo;m quite happy!</p>

<p>When I bought her, I knew that the water pump was leaking so she&rsquo;s got no coolant right now.  Got to pull it off to determine if this is a &ldquo;single&rdquo; or &ldquo;double&rdquo; inlet pump for replacement.  Going to do the pump, hoses, and thermostat and flush/pressure test it quite soon.</p>

<p>When the driver pulled it off of the trailer, evidently the brakes surprised him.  The brakes have NO resistance until the very last bit of the pedal travel.  The master cylinder is new, and the fluid looks clean, so it&rsquo;s either a bubble in the system or a brake line or wheel cylinder is leaking.  That&rsquo;s definately #1 on the list.  If I need to do anything serious here, I&rsquo;ll probably be upgrading it to a later model disc brake system.</p>

<p>I knew that the power door locks didn&rsquo;t work, what I didn&rsquo;t know is that the door locks don&rsquo;t appear to work at all!  I very meticulously made sure all the doors were locked when I parked it on the street, then went to the DMV to transfer ownership.  When I arrived back home I wanted to put the new registration into the glove box.  So, I tried my key in the passenger door lock cylinder.  Hmmn.. Wouldn&rsquo;t fit.  That&rsquo;s okay, lets try the drivers side!  Uhhmn&hellip; Nope, not that one either.  &ldquo;Great, did I just lock myself out of the car on the first day?!&rdquo; I thought to myself.  Then, on a whim I tried the drivers door, though it appeared locked.</p>

<p>I was simultaneously relieved, and paniced when the door popped open without trouble.  Yay!  I didn&rsquo;t lock myself out!  Crap, I can&rsquo;t lock the car!</p>

<p>One good thing I did discover though is that the steering column is indeed tilt AND telescoping.  I was expecting the telescoping adjuster to be in the middle of the steering wheel like on the older models, but as it turns out it&rsquo;s hiding on the top of the column just behind the wheel.  Pretty stoked about that.</p>

<p>Of course, that comes with a down side, the turn signals and emergency flashers don&rsquo;t work apparently because of the switch in the column.</p>

<p>Ohh, and the trunk is missing it&rsquo;s lock cylinder entirely, going to need to pull the rear seat and crawl into the trunk to get her open.</p>

<p>She needs lots of love!  Gotta get the brakes and cooling system in check right quick, and go from there!</p>
