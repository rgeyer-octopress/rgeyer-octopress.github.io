  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&rsquo;s been over two years since I&rsquo;ve blogged anything.  That&rsquo;s a looong time.</p>

<p>You may notice that the blog looks a little different (if you can remember over two years ago)
which is because I&rsquo;ve adopted a Jekyll/Octopress based blog platform instead of
dragging Wordpress along.  The result should be a fair bit faster also.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll likely also notice that the familiar domain name of &ldquo;nslms.com&rdquo; has been
traded in favor of a much more canonically familiar &ldquo;blog.ryangeyer.com&rdquo;, it should
make me, and my blog a little easier to find.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more (if I can shake off the lazy).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a fan of letting my children learn and grown on their own in a controlled environment where I can easily jump in and help or correct or protect my children at any given second.  We call it free range children with a side of helicopter parenting.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m attempting to loosen my reigns on my children of late.  I&rsquo;m also trying to do more activities and learning that my chores will be there when I get to them.  We have been making trips to the library so the boys can do structured social time.  Yeah, that&rsquo;s what I tell myself I&rsquo;m doing when we go to story time.  My eldest loves it and gets oh so excited when the Librarian encourages audience activity, it is awesome.  My youngest doesn&rsquo;t quite get the full library ettiquet, but who can blame the 17 month old, seriously.</p>

<p>Today my eldest squealed with excitement during the songs they sing during story time while my youngest kept chanting &ldquo;Bwabwa&rdquo;, brother for baby speak, and demanded that I let him sit with him.  I let him go hovering close by, thinking that the 17 month old may be getting library protocol.  Nope.  No, my baby decided that the circle was merely an theatre for him to show his awesome dance moves which caused the Librarian to get nervous and remind me of story time rules.</p>

<p>This means I got to quickly leap down into the &lsquo;reading well&rsquo; and grab my child who was pissed I interrupted his greatest preformance ever while my big boy hid his face and shushed us as we worked our way out of the &lsquo;reading well&rsquo;.  I&rsquo;m that parent guys, the crazy helicopter parent with free range children.  How will we survive this?</p>

<p>We have hit the point in the potty training experience where my eldest has deemed potty training fun and he hasn&rsquo;t had a single accident what so ever in a whole month.  One whole month!!!   Know we need to do something extra special for big biggie such a big accomplishment but fir now I&rsquo;m going to bask in his awesomeness.  He is awesome!</p>

<p>It is amazing how much of my world still revolves around the bathroom.  The potty training process began four months ago and yet I have a constant party going on in the bathroom.  I&rsquo;m talking full on cheering, song singing, and dancing occurs on the regular.  I&rsquo;m not quite sure when the potty training party will end as every time either my eldest or I go to the bathroom it become a comical experience.</p>

<p>Things I&rsquo;ve learned in the past few months are:
The empty bathtub is a fantastic place to put a curious one year old while your three year old is using the potty.</p>

<p>Nursery rhymes are the perfect length for hand washing and checking to see if you child has to pee.</p>

<p>Hand washing is fun with three, or at least it is to toddlers.  Personally, I think it&rsquo;s the entire water activity table thing.</p>

<p>There is a fun dance to do even when just drying your hands, don let anyone tell you otherwise.</p>

<p>See, I told you potty training can be party time. :&ndash;)</p>

<p>I have breastfed for some 36 months of life between my two kids.  The end result is I find interesting stuff in my bra on the daily.  So far I&rsquo;ve found:  Cheerios, gold fish crackers, raisins, almonds, granola, cards, kosher salt (my faultnas i foolishly put a small ramikin of it within my baby&rsquo;s reach),and keys to name a few.</p>

<p>The apple sticker had me giggling hysterically in the Victoria Secret dressing room as I attempted to shove my boobs into an overly padded bra that was a cup size too small.  The apple sticker, it was a gala, fluttering slowly to the floor out of my bra added a &ldquo;You are so a mom now&rdquo; vibe to bra shopping I have yet to experience till that moment.  Oh and the overstuffed sausage look when it comes to sexy underwear is not sexy, even when you are shooting for lots of fabulous cleavage.</p>

<h2>date: 2011-09-28 00:00:00 -0700</h2>

<p>I am often asked about best practices for developing, testing and debugging ServerTemplates.  This is my attempt to condense some of the best and most useful bits to make it easier for developers to create and publish some awesome templates.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to break this down into two categories.  First will be general guidelines applicable to any ServerTemplate, and the second will be more focused on ServerTemplates which use Chef for configuration management.</p>

<h1>Launch once test many</h1>


<p>One of the early pitfalls I fell victim to was relaunching my server instance for each change to each script when testing.  As you might imagine this practice can be excruciatingly time consuming!  With that in mind here are some tips on how to reduce the time between making a script change and testing it on a running instance.</p>

<h2>Super size me</h2>


<p>Let&rsquo;s face it, bigger is actually better when it comes to instance sizes.  Larger instances are provisioned and boot faster, they run your installation and configuration routines faster and they just generally make your life easier.</p>

<p>I develop a lot for small Amazon EC2 t1.micro instances.  These instances are seriously restricted in terms of CPU capacity and memory.  As a result, simple activities like installing and compiling ruby gems can be very taxing and time consuming.  As a result, I tend to run significantly higher end instances while doing development.  Running a c1.medium in place of a t1.micro (when targetting a 32bit image) results in a lot less waiting while launching and terminating instances and testing configuration.  The added hourly cost of a faster instance should be more than offset by the optimized use of your time.</p>

<p><strong>RS</strong>
Create a dev &amp; prod RepoPath, keep dev at head/master</p>

<p><strong>Any</strong>
Keep instances up and run scripts against them as operational scripts (or equiv).  On RS, use the rs_agent_dev only DL once option and dev/test on the box.</p>

<p>Stop, Don&rsquo;t terminate.</p>

<p>::File, not File</p>

<p>I am a woman from modest means, I have been for as long as I can remember and it has never bothered me.  My parents were young and never given a hand out of any sort when they decided to marry immediately after high school and start a family.  They weren&rsquo;t shunned but money wasn&rsquo;t handed out.</p>

<p>My life has been modest and I don&rsquo;t think I understood how poor I was as a child until I went through a culinary program at a local city college.  I went in eager to learn, excited to work with all the fancy equipment that I saw on tv.  I went home after the first week completed, eyes wide open and told my mom, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re poor.&rdquo;.</p>

<p>It was amazing how real this words became to me, it wasn&rsquo;t like I was never around those that had more than we did, but I never really cared, I simply figured that was just a different way we were all different.  It wasn&rsquo;t just the magnificent equipment and the amazing amounts of food I was surrounded by in culinary school that let me know I came from a modest home but also the talks about travel I was surrounded by blew my mind.  People around my age, I was only 17 when I started the program, talking about travels to NYC, France, Italy, Spain, all over the globe and it blew me away.  I expected to hear these kinds of stories from my older classmates but not the young ones.</p>

<p>Ironic isn&rsquo;t it?  I spent the majority of my life surrounded by people with means, it was common place for my classmates to flash their newest acquisition in plastic when I was in junior high.  I often rolled my eyes and tried to focus on what I was supposed to be learning.  Yet the gravity of my economic status didn&rsquo;t hit me till I was in college.</p>

<p>The funny part was I guess I was quiet around my classmates in college at first so I was perceived as a snob, and a rich one at that.  People didn&rsquo;t include me in conversations because I didn&rsquo;t get working hard like them, or at least they didn&rsquo;t think so.  Because I was mostly raised in the beautiful town referred to as the &lsquo;American Rivera&rsquo; and wasn&rsquo;t paying exorbadent amounts to rent a closet, and wasn&rsquo;t working while in college; some were convinced I had to come from a great means.  It wasn&rsquo;t until much later that people talked to me and realized quite the opposite.  They found that I was down to earth, friendly, and humble.  I still laugh about the time people thought I was a rich girl.  Though that rep followed me into the work force as the men I worked with in the kitchen teased me as I only had one job while many of them had two, three and one had four jobs.  That rep I accepted because I was a bi</p>

<p>My beloved and I just celebrated out nine year anniversary last month.  I still can&rsquo;t believe that I have been married to my husband for nine years.  I can&rsquo;t believe that we have been in a relationship with each other for ten years.  Where does the time go?</p>

<p>When we met I was only 19, just finished college, just got my driver&rsquo;s license.  My husband was only 20 and dreamy as ever.  Within a couple weeks we were planning our wedding.  Yes, we were one of those sappy couples and shortly after realizing that we really like each other we asked a lot of tough questions like if each one of us wanted kids, how many kids, how to handle money, ect.  When we realized that we were compatible in principles and in what we wanted in life for the long haul, we dreamed and planned.  Then a year later, we were married, blissfully.</p>

<p>Now, nine years after saying I do, we have two wonderful little boys and I do believe that my mister got even more dreamy.  I am thankful for the life we have together, just the four of us and hope for many more years with my beautiful little family.</p>
