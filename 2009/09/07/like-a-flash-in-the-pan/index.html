<p>Welp, my Nikon SB600, which I&#8217;ve had for about a year and a half now has officially been declared dead.  After <a href="/2009/09/06/of-living-insects-and-dying-electronics/">dropping it yesterday</a> it simply wouldn&#8217;t turn on anymore.  I popped it open today hoping to discover what went wrong, after getting it pretty well apart, I noticed this.</p>




<p align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rgeyer/sets/72157622297215940/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2471/3898367957_53ca6334b0.jpg" alt="Broken thingy" /> <img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2617/3899143182_8b4a83311f.jpg" alt="Nother angle of broken thingy" /></a></p>




<p>Apparently the drop cracked the casing the F100 p3D (whatever that is) on the board.  I did a bit of research and apparently permanent damage to the SB600 is fairly common after very minor drops, and in some cases they fail completely without any obvious trauma.  I&#8217;m considering trying to identify and replace this part, but it&#8217;s a surface mount component, and I&#8217;ve never successfully soldered one of those.  Anyone out there know what this thing is?</p>




<p>Even if I can repair it, I&#8217;m gonna go ahead and replace it.  At the moment, I don&#8217;t want another SB600 after reading too many similar cases of failure, I don&#8217;t want to spend ~$300 for something that&#8217;s likely to get broken again quite easily.  I&#8217;d like something that does TTL since that&#8217;s a big part of the reason I liked the SB600.  I&#8217;m going to have to go with a TTL cord instead of using CLS for situations like yesterday where I was using it handheld, but it&#8217;s a small price to pay.  The flash(es) I&#8217;m considering are around the $100 neighborhood and even if I were to break one of those, I can justify replacing one of those.  More on that when I figure it out.</p>




<h3> * UPDATE:</h3>


<p>I&#8217;ve completed this repair, and the SB600 is now working fine, thanks much to David for identifying the inductor!  You can read about my repair <a href="/2011/01/10/long-live-the-nikon-sb600/">here</a>.</p>
