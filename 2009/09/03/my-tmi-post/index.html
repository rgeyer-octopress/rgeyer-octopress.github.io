<p>Warning:  This post may be a bit, um, private or sensitive but it must be said.</p>

<p>Time and time again I see the commercials for Viagra and Levitra and they have their spokesmen saying, puzzled that one medical condition or another has effected their performance in the bedroom.</p>

<p>EVERY SINGLE TIME I yell at the television questioning if that is for real.  I mean really?  You didn&rsquo;t know that things that effect your blood flow to your entire body would effect your erectile function.  For serious!!???</p>

<p>Mkay, I have no medical education.  I only have the education taking care of my grandfather after heart attacks and open heart surgery.  The education that life as a dental assistant gives you.  Which by no means gives me the medical authority of anything.  And yet I know that diabetes, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure can effect erectile function.  I realize in turn that the medication to help with these conditions also can effect erectile function.  WHY ON GOD&rsquo;s GREEN EARTH DON&rsquo;T MOST OF OUR SOCIETY NOT KNOW THIS TOO???!!!???</p>

<p>You need blood to flow to this body part to be able to function to do blank.  Why wouldn&rsquo;t cholesterol which slowly clogs blood vessels effect this function?  Why wouldn&rsquo;t high blood pressure effect this function?  Why wouldn&rsquo;t diabetes which effects so many other aspects of your ability to function not effect erectile function?  I wish instead of using these medications men took the time to take care of themselves to do the best to prevent these issues to the best of their ability.</p>

<p>Too much to ask, I know.  I hear more and more that men are dying from preventable illnesses.  If only they had gone to a doctor and had taken action when a health concern was in the warning or beginning stages.  Yet so many fight it every step of the way.  They are too busy.  They are able to &lsquo;man up&rsquo; through what ever ailment they are coping with.  Sigh.  Yet if they can&rsquo;t get it up they run to their doctor and ask for a pill.</p>

<p>Not often do you hear about a man who can&rsquo;t get it up and they demand that their physician to do a battery of tests to make sure everything is ok.  Make sure that this isn&rsquo;t a precursor to another, bigger, possibly more serious health concern.</p>

<p>What am I getting at?  Guys if you take care of yourself.  If you see a doctor regularly and bring up you concerns that you may have quickly, maybe you won&rsquo;t need the mighty blue pill.  Maybe you will be healthy enough for sex and be able to enjoy a great deal of other  aspects of life.</p>

<p>Common sense people, please use it.</p>
