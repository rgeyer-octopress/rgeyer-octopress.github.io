<p>For the past few weeks there have been a rash of issues with our water supply lines here in our apartment complex.  We&rsquo;ve been without cold or hot water or both for hours at a time.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s culminated into our landlord deciding to basically gut our water lines and replace them.  So since last Friday we&rsquo;ve had folks coming in and tearing out large chunks of our drywall to reveal the plumbing, then the plumbers running new source lines along the outside wall and into each apartment.  Then water was turned off Monday night around 9PM.  The plumbers were coming in on Tuesday to finish hooking up the lines that had been run in parallel to the existing lines.  Well, the water remained off through Tuesday, and we&rsquo;d already forgone bathing for one day so we weren&rsquo;t looking forward to another day without running water.</p>

<p>That brings us to the image above.  We chose to check into the Ramada Inn that&rsquo;s directly next to our apartment complex.  They have this awesome koi pond/lagoon which the hotel surrounds, and as I was walking to the jacuzzi that night, it struck me how pretty the whole scene was a night.</p>

<p>So in an attempt to find a silver lining, I took some timed exposures of the lagoon at night.  I didn&rsquo;t quite get the effect I was looking for, but I think this is a cool shot none the less.</p>
