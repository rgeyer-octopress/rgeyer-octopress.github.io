<p>If you&rsquo;re reading this, it means that the DNS records have replicated and Random Musings is now fully hosted on my shiny <a href="http://www.linode.com/">Linode VPS</a>!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been steadily growing out of my previous hosting solution over on <a href="http://www.hostmysite.com/">Host My Site</a>.  All things being equal they&rsquo;ve served me very well, but running Wordpress started to demand more memory than they&rsquo;d allocate for a shared hosting customer.  Then there&rsquo;s the limited functionality of the PHP stack which I was starting to run up against quite regularly.</p>

<p>I have to say I&rsquo;m SUPER pleased with <a href="http://www.linode.com">Linode</a> so far.  I signed up for it on the 21st, and by today I&rsquo;ve got it completely setup hosting web and email for three domains, with another on the way.  I was worried that it would cost me money, but when I account for the other hosting accounts I&rsquo;ll be able to close I wind up money ahead.  Sweet!</p>

<p>Hopefully this change will be seamless to ya&rsquo;ll, might notice an increase in speed.  Let me know if you see anything &ldquo;odd&rdquo;.  :&ndash;)</p>
