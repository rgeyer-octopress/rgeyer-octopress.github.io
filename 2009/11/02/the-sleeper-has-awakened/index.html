<p>Man, nearly two months without a post here.  Google Analytics tells me I&#8217;m only disappointing about two dozen people, so to you my loyal readers, accept my humblest apologies.  But, I do have an excuse or two!</p>




<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rgeyer/4056790007/" title="Marathon Conference Calls by qwikrex, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3021/4056790007_3a2ae48a63_m.jpg" width="240" height="225" alt="Marathon Conference Calls" class="alignleft" /></a>See, I&#8217;ve been working an insane work schedule.  Pretty much 16-18hours a day 6-7 days a week, mostly on phone calls with an offshore team at odd hours.  When I do have a moment or two that I&#8217;m not working, you can bet the last thing I want to be doing is sitting in front of a computer typing a blog post.</p>




<p>To add to that, we moved out of our two bedroom townhouse at the beginning of October, and are just getting fully settled into our new place.  I&#8217;m TOTALLY excited about the new house.  We&#8217;ve got three bedrooms and one and a half baths, it&#8217;s single story which is great because Q can roam around as he pleases.  It&#8217;s also got a great, and quite large sun room that opens into the backyard, this has become Q&#8217;s defacto playroom which is excellent.  Plus, we&#8217;ve got a bigger kitchen, a proper dining area where we can sit and eat as a family, and I have my very own office and *drumroll* TWO CAR GARAGE!</p>




<p>Now that we&#8217;re settled in the new house, and the deadline for work is approaching things are starting to drift back toward &#8220;normal&#8221; as if there is such a thing for our family.  I even managed to grab a couple hours to work on the Cadillac today, and write this blog entry!  HUZZAH!</p>




<p>In the meantime, my wife has done an excellent job of providing content since I made her an author here to.  You may have noticed <!--<a href="#">&#8211;>her posts<!--</a>&#8211;>.  I&#8217;m totally stoked to have her writing here since I strongly believe she has a future in writing short stories or novels!  I still have two or three of her drafts which I need to review and publish.  And no, I&#8217;m not doing a macho &#8220;you need me to post for you, you don&#8217;t have the permissions&#8221; thing, she&#8217;s just not confident enough yet to post without me reviewing/editing.  We&#8217;ll change that soon enough.  ;-)</p>




<p>Stay tuned to this space for more, as I&#8217;ll be trying to actually keep things up to date again.  :-)</p>
