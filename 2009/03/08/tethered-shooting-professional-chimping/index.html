<p>Okay, first..&nbsp; This post/rant was inspired by a few tweets from Chase Jarvis.&nbsp; That said, I&#8217;m not throwing stones, or trying to start a fight.&nbsp; The topic just got me thinking and I&nbsp;wanted to share my train of thought.&nbsp; Chase, and any other professional who shots tethered, I&#8217;m actually jealous.&nbsp; I&nbsp;wish I&nbsp;could shoot tethered.</p>

<p>So, the gist of the tweet(s) was about shooting tethered with the Nikon D3x and Aperture on a MacBook.&nbsp; At first I&nbsp;thought &quot;curse you Chase and your justifiable budget for fancy gear cause you&#8217;re a professional&quot;.&nbsp; But then I&nbsp;thought, isn&#8217;t this just the professional expensive version of chimping?&nbsp; If you&#8217;ve not heard of chimping, wikipedia has the best description I&#8217;ve seen <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimping">here</a>.</p>


<p>See, since I&nbsp;got my dSLR I&#8217;ve been reading a lot around photography communities, forums, and the like.&nbsp; In that time, I&#8217;ve been able to gather that &quot;chimping&quot;&nbsp;is considered a weakness, and that &quot;real professionals&quot; don&#8217;t do it.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t really subscribe to this mentality, afterall the manufacturers put the LCD&nbsp;on the back for a reason right?</p>


<p>I&#8217;ve recently shut off the automatic review of photos on my Nikon D80, for a number of reasons.&nbsp; For one, it&#8217;s distracting to have the LCD&nbsp;glowing into your eye when you&#8217;re shooting a lot of shots in a dark situation, like in our living room at night capturing something our son is doing.&nbsp; Also, the dials on the camera change function when the LCD&nbsp;is on to move back and forth between photographs, and the info that&#8217;s overlaid.&nbsp; So if you shoot a shot, and keep the viewfinder to your eye, but try to change the exposure it&#8217;s ineffective and you just scroll through the pictures.</p>


<p>That said, when I&#8217;m doing anything other than &quot;snap shots&quot; I&nbsp;find myself pushing the play button to see the shot I&nbsp;just took.&nbsp; Needless to say I&#8217;d gladly shoot tethered.&nbsp; At the moment I&nbsp;have nothing but Windows and Linux based systems, and I&nbsp;haven&#8217;t commited to software for a RAW&nbsp;workflow or other tools that would allow me to shoot tethered, but I&nbsp;can assure you when/if I&nbsp;have all the tools necessary I&#8217;ll probably do it too.</p>


<p>So, I&nbsp;say to the critics of chimping&#8230;&nbsp; Is tethered shooting really just an expensive version of chimping?&nbsp; Is it &quot;OK&quot;&nbsp;for a professional to shoot tethered, and if so why is it any different than us mere mortals looking at the LCD&nbsp;on the back of our camera?&nbsp; I submit that you are just jealous, like I&nbsp;am so you fabricate reasons that this practice is &quot;bad&quot;&nbsp;and makes you &quot;weak&quot;.</p>
