<p>First, I&rsquo;m amazed that I didn&rsquo;t mention this here yet!  The picture above is of my previous daily driver, a 1999 Ford Explorer.  On April 7th my wife was driving it home after a light rain, and while accellerating onto an onramp she lost control, spun around 180 degrees and rolled it one time.</p>

<p>Fortunately, she was mostly unharmed.  A few bruises, some cuts, and a few pounds of glass in her hair (only a slight exaggeration) was all she suffered.</p>

<p>I got our insurance company on the case the very next day, and they paid out in about 2.5 weeks from the initial claim.  &ldquo;In good hands&rdquo; indeed!  I paid the salvage fee so I could keep the wreck and part it out.</p>

<p>So, what I&rsquo;ve been busy with is dismantling this, working on a few computer jobs, and shopping for the X&rsquo;s successor.  And, I&rsquo;ve found it&hellip;</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">It&#8217;s a 1967 Cadillac Sedan Deville.  My wife, our son, and I all jumped into the van and drove down to LA this past weekend, and took a look at her.  I picked this car up for a cool $1000, and promptly scheduled an auto transport company to tote it from Fontana to our door step in Santa Barbara.</p>


<p style="text-align: left;">As we speak it should be getting loaded onto the auto transport rig, and I should have it here by tomorrow.</p>


<p style="text-align: left;">Stay tuned as I have LOTS in store for this car since it&#8217;ll be my new project, and daily driver!</p>
