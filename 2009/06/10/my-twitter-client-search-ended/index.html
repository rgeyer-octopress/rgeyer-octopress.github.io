<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rgeyer/3613715245/"><img class="aligncenter" longdesc="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rgeyer/3613715245/" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3377/3613715245_c590a530d3.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>


<p style="text-align: left;">Okay, so as you may already know I&#8217;m a big fan of any software solution that does what I need in a portable and platform agnostic way, particularly if it does it &#8221;<a href="/categories/cloud-computing/">in the cloud</a>&#8221;.</p>


<p style="text-align: left;">What you may not know, is that I&#8217;m addicted to <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> and I&#8217;ve been going through desktop based Twitter clients faster than <a href="/categories/1967-cadillac-sedan-deville/">my Cadillac</a> beer bongs fuel!  My affair with desktop clients started with <a href="http://tweetdeck.com/beta/">TweetDeck</a>, since it&#8217;s used by a lot of my friends on Twitter and it seemed to be a front runner.  The problem is that it&#8217;s in beta, and it&#8217;s a bit buggy still.  Worse yet, it doesn&#8217;t run on my linux box.  In fact, no decent Twitter client does work on my linux box.  I&#8217;ve also tried <a href="http://www.twhirl.org/">Twhirl</a>, and <a href="https://destroytwitter.com/">DestroyTwitter</a>.  Both of which lack all the features TweetDeck has, and none of which work &#8220;quite right&#8221; on my linux box.</p>


<p style="text-align: left;">And, as if to add insult to injury the company I work for has recently been acquired by a MUCH bigger company which is imposing a lot of new restrictions to the use of our desktop computers.  Meaning I&#8217;ll likely not be able to install a Twitter desktop app on my computer in about a month.</p>


<p style="text-align: left;">Enter <a href="http://www.twittergadget.com/">TwitterGadget</a>, pictured above.  It&#8217;s an iGoogle gadget so it runs in my browser, on windows or linux, without installing!  And it&#8217;s quite featureful too! It has built in URL shortening which is one of the features I miss most from other desktop apps.  The one feature I hope to be included soon is <a href="http://tweetshrink.com/">TweetShrink</a> integration, but I&#8217;ll live without it.</p>


<p style="text-align: left;">Hopefully I won&#8217;t have to change Twitter clients for a while now!  :-)</p>
