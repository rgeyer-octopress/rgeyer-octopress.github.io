<p>I have been a stay at home mom for a little over a year now and my world seriously revolves around the needs and wants of my children and errands and chores from 8-5 every day, if not longer.  My focus is interacting, teaching, and molding the young minds left in my care until they are grown by my standards.  This includes learning how to play keep the playdoh out of the baby&rsquo;s mouth and out of electronics.  Learning about a huge selection of good music and learning what they prefer.   The result?  This once ever so interesting woman that had interesting things to say is so tired and most of my ideas are hibernating by the time I get a chance to have a real adult conversation.</p>

<p>This means that when my ever so intelligent husband gets home he is often greeted by our adorable boys with open arms and squeals of joy while I take a deep breath and prepare to be a listening ear.  Now, I love and adore my husband and he is an very intelligent man, like bordering on genius intelligent, so there is a degree of preparing myself to hear what he has to say.  When your day is filled with nursery rhymes and instructing your children on what is and is not acceptable, like no, shoving your brother off the couch is not ok even if you feel like he&rsquo;s taking up too much room, my great and hilarious epiphanies have faded in the background.</p>

<p>My husband comes home eager to talk about his day at work, he loves his job, and I am thankful for it.  I seriously make mental notes while he talks about things I could learn more about, I have even been known to google something he has mentioned in passing.  I try to participate but my background is in culinary arts, dental practices, and the very basic HR and management principles while my husband is all about code, security and cloud computing.  We hit a common ground with cars and technology but we are on different plains there too, thankfully there are a slew of other topics we talk about but at the end of the day I am so knee deep in potty training, diaper changing, and all things childcaring related I am just happy to hear an adult talk to me about adult things.</p>

<p>Every day I attempt to watch the news, maybe a documentary, something that is relevant or up to date but it is an attempt.  I fall asleep during the late night news, I&rsquo;m half awake for the early morning news while stealing a little more sleep after nursing my youngest before my eldest wakes up.  I try to watch the evening news while making and serving dinner to my boys.  I look at the news sites both national and local but Lordy that only lasts a few minutes too.  The running joke with my mom about movies or shows we watch streaming is that though I may have &lsquo;watched&rsquo; said thing a couple of times, I have yet to watch it completely.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m trying to stay interesting to myself and that is a feat within it&rsquo;s self.  I&rsquo;m going to do it, I&rsquo;m determined to do it, now if only we could get an extra five hours in a day I would be golden.</p>
