<p>You&rsquo;ve heard the colloquialism that &ldquo;Time is Money&rdquo; right?  Perhaps you agree, or perhaps you just scoff at the sentiment.</p>

<p>I, for one, have given this particular little proverb a good amount of though.  So much so, that I usually work out how much something will &ldquo;cost&rdquo; me for my time before I get serious about diving into it.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>See, I&rsquo;m a DIY kinda guy, I like to work on my own cars, I like to build DIY versions of retail products, etc.  But before I take something on I usually try to break down exactly what it&rsquo;ll cost me both in time and money.</p>

<h2>DIY R-Strap</h2>


<p>For those of you who may not know, I fancy myself something of an amateur photographer, and I tend to carry my dSLR around with me a lot.</p>

<p>I discovered very quickly that the standard neck camera strap is just downright cumbersome, and it often flops in front of the lens at the most inopportune times.</p>

<p>I could throw it over my neck, and under one arm.  But, I&rsquo;m a bit of a big guy too so that just results in a strap that&rsquo;s too short for me to get the camera to my eye.</p>

<p>As a result, when I discovered the <a href="http://www.blackrapid.com/product/camera-strap/rs-4/">BlackRapid R-Strap</a> I instantly fell in love.</p>

<p>Of course, being the DIY guy I am, I immediately went looking for DIY instructions for it, and I found <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=diy+rstrap">plenty</a> without looking too hard.</p>

<p>Now comes the breakdown.  An RS-4 (the model that seemed most appropriate for me) costs around $60 all things considered.  Most of the DIY instructions show parts lists that add up to less than $10.</p>

<p>Sweet deal right?</p>

<p>Well, not exactly.  See, I easily spent two hours looking at all of the different DIY plans and devising my own &ldquo;best of&rdquo; from those.</p>

<p>Then, since I didn&rsquo;t have any of the parts on hand I&rsquo;d have to go to a home improvement center for the hardware, and possibly a different store to get some nylon strapping or strap from an existing bag.  Figure on another hour or so driving to and from, and wandering around.</p>

<p>Then, once I had all the materials together building my strap, testing, adjusting, rebuilding, and cleaning up could easily take another two hours.</p>

<p>Assuming that I don&rsquo;t have to drive to any other stores to buy materials I forgot, or later decided that I need to improve my design I&rsquo;ve already spent five hours.</p>

<p>$60 (Price of retail R-Strap) &ndash; $10 (Price of DIY parts) = $50 / 5hr = $10/hr</p>

<p>All told, I&rsquo;d be paying myself $10/hr to build my own R-Strap.  Then, what are the chances that I&rsquo;d end up with a product that is better (or even as good) as the mass produced, tested, and redesigned product?</p>

<p>So.. Not better, not really cheaper..</p>

<p>I bought an RS-4 from a retailer.</p>

<h2>Choosing how to spend</h2>


<p>Sometimes, you can look at a task and realize that it&rsquo;d cost you WAY less to pay someone for a particular product or service, but you still choose to do it yourself.</p>

<p>You do this usually for the non monetary benefits you receive.</p>

<p>Or, perhaps you could never hope to spare that much cash, but you&rsquo;re willing and able to spend the time.</p>

<p>For me, working on cars is where I choose to spend the time, rather than the money.</p>

<p>Sure, most times I probably take two to three times longer to fix or modify my car than a professional would, and I know I earn more hourly than the shop would charge.  But I get a sense of satisfaction in my work, the knowledge that it&rsquo;s done &ldquo;right&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Besides, working with my hands is cathartic given that I sit on my duff behind a keyboard all day.</p>

<p>Mind you, there are times that I decide that the cost of time is too great to complete a project, and I&rsquo;ll gladly pay a professional to take care of it.  This is particularly the case for the cars which we depend upon for transportation.</p>

<h2>Billable hours</h2>


<p>The other thing to consider is.  You can&rsquo;t possibly bill for your every waking hour.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve got the time to spare, and you can&rsquo;t monetize it, then you&rsquo;re wasting a resource if you&rsquo;re not doing something you enjoy (recreation) or being productive.</p>

<p>If you ask me, time is money in a very tangible way, so make sure you&rsquo;re making the most of both.</p>

<p>Remember, if you&rsquo;re going to spend more time on something that it&rsquo;d be worth monetarily, make sure you&rsquo;re doing it for the right reasons.</p>
