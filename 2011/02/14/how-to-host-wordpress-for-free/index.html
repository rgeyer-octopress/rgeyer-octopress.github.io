<p>If you&rsquo;re looking to start a blog to promote your business, or boost your presence on the internet, you&rsquo;ve probably heard of <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a>.</p>

<p>You may also have heard about the <a href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/com-vs-org/">benefits</a> of hosting your own instance of Wordpress, but you&rsquo;re intimidated by the idea of setting up and maintaining your own server, or trusting your business to a shared hosting solution.</p>

<p>What if I told you that I&rsquo;ve got a solution that&rsquo;ll let you run your Wordpress blog, on your very own server, with automated backups and disaster recover, completely free?</p>

<p>Wait wait! I know it sounds too good to be true, but don&rsquo;t leave just yet, hear me out&hellip;</p>

<h2>Amazon AWS Free Tier</h2>


<p>First, let me be straight with you.  When I say &ldquo;free&rdquo; I&rsquo;m referring to the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/free/">free tier</a> of Amazon&rsquo;s virtual computing and storage platform AWS.</p>

<p>This free tier allows you to run their smallest instance free for one year.  In practice you actually end up paying them a very small sum (around $0.12 average for me thus far) each month for transfer costs to run a low to medium traffic blog.</p>

<p>After your first year of free usage has expried, it&rsquo;ll start to cost around $15 per month to keep using the same size instance.</p>

<h2>Managed by RightScale</h2>


<p>You may be looking at AWS and thinking that setting up your own server, and keeping it running and backed up would be a daunting task, and it can be.  That&rsquo;s where <a href="http://www.rightscale.com/">RightScale</a> comes into the picture.</p>

<p>RightScale offers a <a href="http://www.rightscale.com/products/free_edition.php">Free Developer Edition</a> that gives you access to their shared library of ServerTemplates.</p>

<p>In that library is one little gem that I published, expressly for the purpose of running a server that hosts my blog, a few sites for other domains I own, as well as all of the email traffic for my various domains.</p>

<p>In fact, you&rsquo;re reading this right now from a server running from <a href="http://www.rightscale.com/library/server_templates/Web-LAMP-Email-Postfix-vhost-A/17057">this ServerTemplate</a>.</p>

<h2>Full Disclosure</h2>


<p>Before I give you the skinny on how to start using these tools to host a Wordpress blog on your own virtual server, a few warnings are in order.</p>

<p>I am using <a href="http://www.opscode.com/chef/">Opscode Chef</a> to configure the server.  Chef support is currently in <em><strong>Beta</strong></em> on RightScale, meaning that they do not recommend you use it to configure and manage &ldquo;Production&rdquo; servers.</p>

<p>It also means that there can be some hiccups when you&rsquo;re launching and configuring a server with this ServerTemplate.</p>

<p>So, don&rsquo;t be surprised if the first time you launch your server, it doesn&rsquo;t work.  Try launching a second time.</p>

<p>Lastly, I can&rsquo;t take any responsibility for any loss of self esteem, data, productivity, or sanity.  You have been warned.</p>

<p>That said, I&rsquo;m using this server to run the very blog you&rsquo;re reading, and I haven&rsquo;t had any significant glitches yet.  RightScale is working as we speak to improve their support for Chef and things will only get better from here.</p>

<p>Haven&rsquo;t scared you off yet? Okay, good..  Here we go..</p>

<h2>20 Minute Quickstart</h2>

<h2>What&#8217;s Next?</h2>


<p>That&rsquo;s really all there is to it.  As I mentioned the ServerTemplate does a number of other cool things, which you can read about in it&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.rightscale.com/library/server_templates/Web-LAMP-Email-Postfix-vhost-A/17057">description</a>.</p>

<p>The best part is that because this ServerTemplate is what I use for my own blog and email hosting duties, you can be sure that I&rsquo;ll keep it up to date, secure, and be adding features fairly regularly.</p>

<h2>Drop me a note</h2>


<p>If you followed these directions, or if you&rsquo;re using this ServerTemplate, or if you&rsquo;re having trouble, by all means drop me a note in the comments here.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be happy to answer any questions I can, and I&rsquo;d love to get a sense for how many people are out there running servers based on this template, it&rsquo;ll keep me motivated to publish more stuff in the public ServerTemplate library!</p>
