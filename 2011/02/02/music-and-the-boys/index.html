<p>Both my boys seem to have interest in music, singing, drumming, and dancing.  Due to the chance meeting of my beloved and I being an affair he was DJing this is very dear to my heart.  We are a music loving household.</p>

<p>I have noticed there is a difference between the boys preferences in that baby boy is quick to join in my silliness happily and willingly.  The toddler on the other hand isn&rsquo;t a fan of my singing, my voice is pretty but nothing to write home about.  He can&rsquo;t stand my dancing unless I&rsquo;m spinning him.  Oh and he&rsquo;s not sure about my music choices when it involves me singing along.  Now that means rap is fine as I can&rsquo;t rap to save my life.</p>

<p>I had no idea that these little beings would be such critics so early on.  I am noticing that the toddler has deemed music with daddy is fine as long as he doesn&rsquo;t act too much like me when listening.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to explain to my eldest boy that if it wasn&rsquo;t for mommy and her dancing ways he might not be here. :-P</p>
