<p>If you&rsquo;re like me, every time you get an invitation for one of the RightScale webinars you&rsquo;re super excited and sign up right away, anxious to see what they have prepared.  Perhaps like me you also manage to forget, and the reminder from your calendar application of choice doesn&rsquo;t pop up.</p>

<p>Fortunately, for the chronically late but still insatiably curious, RightScale has published all of their public webinars as well as talks from their most recent User Conference on a free iTunes podcast channel!</p>

<p>So to take advantage of the full wealth of information that&rsquo;s regularly disseminated, point your browser or iTunes <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/ee/podcast/rightscale-video-podcast/id410153139">here</a>.  Then absorb the information at your own pace.</p>

<p>They just wrapped the webinar &ldquo;Managing RightScale on RightScale&rdquo; which I caught the last half of.  It should be posted on the iTunes channel soon so I can catch the first half that I missed!</p>
