<p>Moving on up!  Ok, not really.  My youngest little man is mobile and moving at ridiculous speeds.  When I went to his four month appointment his physician mentioned that I should have the baby gates up and prepared to keep baby boy from any and all possible dangerous incidents, well all that wouldn&rsquo;t involve my toddler, his amazing big brother.  I realized the child safety latches on cabinets and doors and outlet covers that we keep in place for our toddler isn&rsquo;t enough for our newly mobile baby.</p>

<p>My son like all the men in my life is drawn to the dangerous and shiny.  I also learned that my toddler and baby will be a force to be reckoned and yet they will tell on each other often.  Example:  Toddler opened the gate to, as he puts it, check on the baby.  Upon leaving the gated area he was in a hurry due to being an out of control airplane and it didn&rsquo;t occur to him to close the gate.  Baby gets free while I am peeing and when I come out of the bathroom I find the baby drumming on the torch in the living room while the toddler is screaming, &ldquo;Baby no touch that!!!&rdquo;.  They totally ratted each other out, but now we have to make it abundantly clear toddler isn&rsquo;t allowed to open and close the gate unless supervised.</p>

<p>So now when I sit in the living room, otherwise known as mom&rsquo;s room according to the toddler I am surrounded by a giant play yard.  When I do laundry my kids watch from the other side of a gate.  This is my personal gated community and frankly the view is lovely. ;&ndash;)</p>
