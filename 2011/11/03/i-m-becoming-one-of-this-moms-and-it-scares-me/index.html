<p>I&rsquo;m a fan of letting my children learn and grown on their own in a controlled environment where I can easily jump in and help or correct or protect my children at any given second.  We call it free range children with a side of helicopter parenting.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m attempting to loosen my reigns on my children of late.  I&rsquo;m also trying to do more activities and learning that my chores will be there when I get to them.  We have been making trips to the library so the boys can do structured social time.  Yeah, that&rsquo;s what I tell myself I&rsquo;m doing when we go to story time.  My eldest loves it and gets oh so excited when the Librarian encourages audience activity, it is awesome.  My youngest doesn&rsquo;t quite get the full library ettiquet, but who can blame the 17 month old, seriously.</p>

<p>Today my eldest squealed with excitement during the songs they sing during story time while my youngest kept chanting &ldquo;Bwabwa&rdquo;, brother for baby speak, and demanded that I let him sit with him.  I let him go hovering close by, thinking that the 17 month old may be getting library protocol.  Nope.  No, my baby decided that the circle was merely an theatre for him to show his awesome dance moves which caused the Librarian to get nervous and remind me of story time rules.</p>

<p>This means I got to quickly leap down into the &lsquo;reading well&rsquo; and grab my child who was pissed I interrupted his greatest preformance ever while my big boy hid his face and shushed us as we worked our way out of the &lsquo;reading well&rsquo;.  I&rsquo;m that parent guys, the crazy helicopter parent with free range children.  How will we survive this?</p>
