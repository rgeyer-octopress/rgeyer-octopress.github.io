<p>I was told on numerous occasions by the veterans of motherhood that you&rsquo;d be amazed with the strange things you will, not may, but <em>will</em> say.  It&rsquo;s completely true.  I was amazed by the truth of it when i had my first child, but the things that have come out of my mouth since having my second, dear lord!  They are so out there that even I find myself repeating them out of shock and amazement.</p>

<blockquote>Son, don&#8217;t headbutt me.</blockquote>




<blockquote>Stop sniffing your brother&#8217;s butt!&#8221;</blockquote>




<blockquote>Seriously son, look where you&#8217;re running.  You will run into a wall like you did last time if you don&#8217;t look ahead!</blockquote>




<blockquote>Whatever your name is, stop it!</blockquote>


<p>I regularly consider sharing these comical statements with family and other times I wonder if I&rsquo;m the first one having to say some of these things.  I know I&rsquo;m not but dear lord I would love to meet some moms out there having to yell things like;</p>

<blockquote>It&#8217;s not nice to drool all over your brother.  I just put him in that outfit.</blockquote>


<p>Or the ever embarrassing;</p>

<blockquote>Please don&#8217;t bite my butt!  That&#8217;s gross!</blockquote>
