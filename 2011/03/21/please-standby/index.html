<p>You may (or may not) have noticed that there has not been much activity here over the past couple months.  There are a number of reasons for that, but I&rsquo;ll spare you the excuses.  I&rsquo;m here to tell you that things are about to change.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>There are posts about parenthood and child rearing epiphanies from the lovely Marlena (my wife) scheduled for every Wednesday and Friday from now through just about the end of April.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m digging back into my drafts and fleshing out previous trains of through, and starting some new cloud computing projects which I&rsquo;ll be excited to share.  I&rsquo;m also hope to be finding time to work on, and blog about my Cadillac restoration project.</p>

<p>So, if you were anxiously awaiting every new post here, sorry for the mini hiatus.  But we&rsquo;re getting things back in gear and should be producing some interesting new posts on the regular!</p>
