<p>For visitors to your blog, one of the biggest factors that contributes to the load time of the page is the static content.  Stuff like pictures, CSS, Javascript files, etc.</p>

<p>One of the best ways you can improve this performance is to serve those things from a Content Delivery Network (CDN).  Follow along as I show you how to configure your Wordpress blog to use Amazon S3 as a CDN for delivering static content!</p>

<h1>What you&#8217;ll need</h1>


<ul>
    <li>An Amazon AWS account</li>
    <li>The <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/tantan-s3/">Amazon S3</a> plugin for Wordpress</li>
    <li>The <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ossdl-cdn-off-linker/">CDN Offlinker</a> plugin for Wordpress</li>
</ul>


<p>The first step is going to be setting up the S3 bucket where you&rsquo;re going to host your files.</p>

<p>Since we&rsquo;re going to be handing over access to the AWS API for S3 to a Wordpress plugin, we should create a new <a href="/2011/03/28/create-aws-service-accounts-with-iam/">IAM Service Account</a> and set up a <a href="/2011/06/27/policy-for-an-s3-only-amazon-iam-user/">security policy</a> which restricts that accounts access to only the S3 bucket we setup.</p>

<p>The next thing we want to do is upload all of the content from our /wp-include and /wp-content directories up to the bucket we created.</p>

<p>Make sure to &ldquo;Make Public&rdquo; everything you uploaded.</p>

<p>Once we&rsquo;ve done that, we can go enable our Wordpress plugins.  First enable Amazon S3 plugin.</p>
