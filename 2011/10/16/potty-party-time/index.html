<p>It is amazing how much of my world still revolves around the bathroom.  The potty training process began four months ago and yet I have a constant party going on in the bathroom.  I&rsquo;m talking full on cheering, song singing, and dancing occurs on the regular.  I&rsquo;m not quite sure when the potty training party will end as every time either my eldest or I go to the bathroom it become a comical experience.</p>

<p>Things I&rsquo;ve learned in the past few months are:
The empty bathtub is a fantastic place to put a curious one year old while your three year old is using the potty.</p>

<p>Nursery rhymes are the perfect length for hand washing and checking to see if you child has to pee.</p>

<p>Hand washing is fun with three, or at least it is to toddlers.  Personally, I think it&rsquo;s the entire water activity table thing.</p>

<p>There is a fun dance to do even when just drying your hands, don let anyone tell you otherwise.</p>

<p>See, I told you potty training can be party time. :&ndash;)</p>
