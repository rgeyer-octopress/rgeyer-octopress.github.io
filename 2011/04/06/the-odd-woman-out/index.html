<p>That&rsquo;s me, I am the odd woman out in my home.  I have two boys and my husband and often it feels like an all boy house as I cuddle in my favorite spot on the couch and attempt to read something girly.  I&rsquo;m happy to have my boys, they are awesome, I wouldn&rsquo;t trade either of them for a girl ever.  I find that all the boys get kind of quiet as my husband works on something techie, car related, or yard work related in their presence.</p>

<p>Now that my 3 year old is becoming aware of everything and wants to talk about everything he likes to remind me that I&rsquo;m different.  I&rsquo;m shorter than my husband, by over a foot, I have curly hair he has straight hair, etc.  His newest epiphany?   Penises.  Good times, let me tell you.</p>

<p>We had the following conversation:</p>

<p>3yr old: &ldquo;I has a pianus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Me:  &ldquo;Yes you do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>3yr old:  &ldquo;Baby brother has a pianus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Me: &ldquo;Yes he does.&rdquo;</p>

<p>3yr old: &ldquo;Daddy has a pianus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Me:  &ldquo;Yes he does, good job son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>3yr old:  &ldquo;You has a pianus?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Me:  &ldquo;No I do not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>3yr old: Looks at me shocked and with pity, &ldquo;You not has a pianus mommy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Me:  &ldquo;No son, I don&rsquo;t have a penis.  I&rsquo;m a girl and girls don&rsquo;t have penises.&rdquo;</p>

<p>3yr old:  Furrows brows and gives me a concerned look, &ldquo;Mommy not has a pianus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Me:  &ldquo;Yes son, I do not have a penis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>3yr old:  Smiles, &ldquo;But Daddy and baby brother and me has a pianus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Me:  &ldquo;Right again son.  Good job.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure my son will ever look at me the same way again now knowing that not only do I have lactating breasts but I don&rsquo;t have a penis.  He really seemed to be so concerned that I didn&rsquo;t have such an important body part.  I laughed hysterically after he left the room.  I think his epiphanies will often leave me cracking up even when it means I am in fact the odd woman out.</p>
