<p>We had a great day and when it came to today&rsquo;s outing, we stretched it out over two hours and the first thing our potty training star did was map out the potty available and tried it out.</p>

<p>Yeah, he is awesome.</p>

<p>He didn&rsquo;t have a single accident and was even applauding himself by the time we got home.  He is a bit of show off. :&ndash;)  I&rsquo;m so proud of my big boy.</p>
