<p>A lot of things have been said about how the new Amazon GPU cluster compute instance could be a serious threat for brute force password cracking, but what if you were to fight fire with fire?</p>

<p>Use a GPU cluster instance to hash your passwords for you, using an obscenely high &ldquo;cost&rdquo; value, using bcrypt.  Would take even this massively powerful instance ~100ms to hash, and you would has inbound passwords to compare them against stored hashes as well.  Nutz, right?</p>

<p>You could then have your GPU cluster instance setup expressly for the purpose of hashing these passwords, and store them elsewhere, confident that they are secure.</p>

<p>Fight fire with fire.</p>
