<p>Have to use the LdapShaPassword<whateveritsnameis> bean to create and hash it properly.  Correct size hash is ___</p>

<p>OpenLDAP doesn&rsquo;t support SHA-256 or SHA-512 out of the box, so it has to be added.</p>

<p>ApacheDS doesn&rsquo;t support SHA-256 or SHA-512 until 1.5.6..  ldap-server plugin uses 1.5.4</p>

<p>Gotta use something else to create stuff in the directory if you don&rsquo;t have another mechanism.  ldap plugin (gldapo) with the encryption/hashing mentioned above.</p>

<p>If you want to pull authority info from the DAO objects (we did) you have to implement a custom <what 's that context thingy?></what></whateveritsnameis></p>
