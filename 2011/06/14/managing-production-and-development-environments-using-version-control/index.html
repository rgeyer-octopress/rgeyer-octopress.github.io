<p>Use branches or tags on config files to easily permit many environments of a web app.</p>

<p>Example is the MOFCart, so I can run it locally and on bluezap.</p>

<p>Or, maybe my standalone PHP apps, where I want to run them locally (for dev) and on one or more &ldquo;production&rdquo; boxes.</p>
