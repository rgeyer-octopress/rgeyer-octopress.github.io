It's been over two years since I've blogged anything.  That's a looong time.

You may notice that the blog looks a little different (if you can remember over two years ago)
which is because I've adopted a Jekyll/Octopress based blog platform instead of
dragging Wordpress along.  The result should be a fair bit faster also.

You'll likely also notice that the familiar domain name of "nslms.com" has been
traded in favor of a much more canonically familiar "blog.ryangeyer.com", it should
make me, and my blog a little easier to find.

Stay tuned for more (if I can shake off the lazy).
