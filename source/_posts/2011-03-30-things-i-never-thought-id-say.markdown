I was told on numerous occasions by the veterans of motherhood that you'd be amazed with the strange things you will, not may, but <em>will</em> say.  It's completely true.  I was amazed by the truth of it when i had my first child, but the things that have come out of my mouth since having my second, dear lord!  They are so out there that even I find myself repeating them out of shock and amazement.

<blockquote>Son, don't headbutt me.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Stop sniffing your brother's butt!"</blockquote>

<blockquote>Seriously son, look where you're running.  You will run into a wall like you did last time if you don't look ahead!</blockquote>

<blockquote>Whatever your name is, stop it!</blockquote>

I regularly consider sharing these comical statements with family and other times I wonder if I'm the first one having to say some of these things.  I know I'm not but dear lord I would love to meet some moms out there having to yell things like;

<blockquote>It's not nice to drool all over your brother.  I just put him in that outfit.</blockquote>

Or the ever embarrassing;

<blockquote>Please don't bite my butt!  That's gross!</blockquote>
