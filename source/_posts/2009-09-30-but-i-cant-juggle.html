Of late the hubs and I have been trying to do everything at once.  Weaning our son, and encouraging him to sleep in his own bed.  Both of us have been crazy busy with our jobs.  We have been searching for a new home to rent.  I have been attempting to get in better shape so as to be able to keep up with a baby boy and keep my health in check to the best of my abilities.  We keep trying to keep our home clean, which seems to only last for a moment after cleaning.  Trying to really take the time to catch up with each other and making sure both of us are really getting the down time that we need.  It simply has been crazy.  

Now we are recovering from a long weekend of attempting to do all of it, and do it well.  My son is finally sleeping for a good stretch.  It is peaceful in my home right now.

I just saw a LOVELY home that I want to live in but it is simply too small for our needs.  The home we looked at last night is simply bigger than we need.  I am so bummed that we can't make the charming little place work.  Did I mention that my husband is chomping at the bit when it comes to the larger home?  *sigh*

I am just trying to figure out how to make everything fit in our lives and make sure nothing is being neglected.  To be a good woman, a good wife, a good mother, a good daughter, a good sister...it is a hell of a lot to juggle.  I am learning but dear lord, every time I think I have everything under control something new pops up.  I can't wait till the home search is done.
