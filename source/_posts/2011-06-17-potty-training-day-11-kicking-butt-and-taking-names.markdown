Yeah, my son was a rock start today.

He proudly would announce that he used the potty all by himself, with a dance.  Yes, I had to escort him back to the bathroom to wash his hands and wash my own hands since I high fived him with glee before remembering that he can't turn the faucet on by himself.

Yes my son was a potty trained big boy and for the umpteenth time I have realized that my children are growing before my very eyes and it is happening way too fast but this is the wild ride I volunteered for.

For now I'm just going to enjoy a song and dance with my son potty training skillZ, yeah with a capital <strong>Z</strong>.
