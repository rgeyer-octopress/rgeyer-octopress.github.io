It is amazing how much of my world still revolves around the bathroom.  The potty training process began four months ago and yet I have a constant party going on in the bathroom.  I'm talking full on cheering, song singing, and dancing occurs on the regular.  I'm not quite sure when the potty training party will end as every time either my eldest or I go to the bathroom it become a comical experience.

Things I've learned in the past few months are:
The empty bathtub is a fantastic place to put a curious one year old while your three year old is using the potty.

Nursery rhymes are the perfect length for hand washing and checking to see if you child has to pee.

Hand washing is fun with three, or at least it is to toddlers.  Personally, I think it's the entire water activity table thing.

There is a fun dance to do even when just drying your hands, don let anyone tell you otherwise.

See, I told you potty training can be party time. :-)
