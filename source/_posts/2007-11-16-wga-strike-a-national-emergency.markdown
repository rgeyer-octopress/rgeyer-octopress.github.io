War in Iraq? Old news.  Lead laden toys from china?  Big deal.  Peak Oil? Puhleez!  Global warming? Pffft.<br /><br />What we really ought to be worried about is the Writers Guild Strike!!<br /><br />Now, you may already be clicking the comments link to remind me about <a href="http://qwikrex.blogspot.com/2007/10/oh-holy-entertainment.html">my rant about our much adored entertainment</a>.  Yeah, I know a bit ironic and hypocritical but I'm really starting to take this strike personally!<br /><br />I don't think I'm prepared to start watching re-runs of Big Bang Theory and Chuck.  Not to mention the inevitable delay of the return of Notes From The Underbelly.<br /><br />I'm still enjoying my made-for-television story telling high from November sweeps week, and I don't think I'll be able to survive the long and arduous drought which lies ahead.  Please, networks, give the writers what they want, and avert a potential national catastrophe!  Well, maybe it's not that bad, but the recent crop of great shows has renewed my faith in entertaining television, I don't think I'm ready to go back!
