<p>I just took delivery of my latest new computer from my employer. &nbsp;This time, instead of another run of the mill IBM compatible laptop or desktop it was a fancy new 17&quot; MacBook Pro. &nbsp;We&#39;re developing software which we&#39;re supporting in Safari using the Silverlight plugin and I needed to be able to develop and test in that native environment.</p>
<p>First, let me give you some background. &nbsp;See, I&#39;m an Apple geek from days of yore. &nbsp;We&#39;re talking Mac II and Quadra days here. &nbsp;I was raised around Apples because my father owned his own business in the desktop publishing industry. &nbsp;Around 1996 or so, I started to defect to &quot;the dark side&quot; and use the Windows OS, and only a few short years later I started dabbling with Linux, which is my current OS of choice.</p>
<p>Now, I knew that OSX was BSD based, and I knew I&#39;d like it. &nbsp;I also knew that the Apple hardware was pretty stinkin&#39; elegant. &nbsp;But man.... I had no idea. &nbsp;This feels all so new and exciting, but at the same time comfortable and familiar. &nbsp;In the ~3hrs I&#39;ve had it I&#39;ve installed pretty much an entire Groovy/Grails development tool set as well as installing and configuring things I&#39;ll be using on a daily basis.</p>
<p>I&#39;m discovering some things which require are requiring a bit of research, but once I find the answer it usually fits some pattern or concept that is very familiar. &nbsp;I&#39;ll likely be blogging about a few of those items as I continue to &quot;move in&quot; to my new machine.</p>
