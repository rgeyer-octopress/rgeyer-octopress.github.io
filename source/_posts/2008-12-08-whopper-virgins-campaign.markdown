What you've just seen is the latest marketing campaign by Burger King.  Every time I see teasers for this on TV, I feel...  I dunno..  Just...  Wrong.

Something about this offends me, and I'm not really sure what it is yet.  There are <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/3546969/Burger-King-under-fire-for-Whopper-Virgins-taste-test-challenge.html">others</a> who feel very strongly about it.  I'm not sure I agree with any one of those opinions directly.  But something about this just doesn't set right with me.

I'd wager that if Burger King were doing this as a purely altruistic endeavor, by providing food to remote villages without the marketing spin people might feel differently, myself in included.  However, as it stands, it feels awfully exploitative for the sake of marketing.
