If you're reading this, it means that the DNS records have replicated and Random Musings is now fully hosted on my shiny <a href="http://www.linode.com/">Linode VPS</a>!

I've been steadily growing out of my previous hosting solution over on <a href="http://www.hostmysite.com/">Host My Site</a>.  All things being equal they've served me very well, but running Wordpress started to demand more memory than they'd allocate for a shared hosting customer.  Then there's the limited functionality of the PHP stack which I was starting to run up against quite regularly.

I have to say I'm SUPER pleased with <a href="http://www.linode.com">Linode</a> so far.  I signed up for it on the 21st, and by today I've got it completely setup hosting web and email for three domains, with another on the way.  I was worried that it would cost me money, but when I account for the other hosting accounts I'll be able to close I wind up money ahead.  Sweet!

Hopefully this change will be seamless to ya'll, might notice an increase in speed.  Let me know if you see anything "odd".  :-)
