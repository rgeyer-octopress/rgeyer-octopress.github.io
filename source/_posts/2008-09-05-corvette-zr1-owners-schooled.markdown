Okay, so I've been a little bit out of the loop on the new Corvette ZR1 in spite of being a Motor Trend subscriber.

Bottom line, this is the fastest car the General has ever produced in any quantity for public consumption.  You can read all about Motor Trend's first drive <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/coupes/112_0810_2009_chevrolet_corvette_zr1_first_drive/index.html">here</a>.

However, my very favorite part is in the first paragraph of <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/coupes/112_0810_2009_chevrolet_corvette_zr1_first_drive/brakes_and_tires.html">this</a> page, where they reveal that every new ZR1 owner will be given the opportunity to attend a free high performance driving school!

It's good to see Chevy taking a proactive approach to educating their customers, particularly when planting them behind the wheel of something as quick as the ZR1.  It's not exactly what I proposed <a href="{{ root_url }}/2008/03/11/check-out-my-new-ride/">here</a>, namely that I should be able to buy a car like the ZR1 if I was able to demonstrate my ability to handle it and my overall enthusiasm for the car, but it's certainly a step in the right direction.  Hey Chevy, how 'bout if I finish a course with Bob Bondurant "with honors" you offer me a discounted ZR1?  Yeah...  Right..
