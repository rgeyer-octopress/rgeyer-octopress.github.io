Our new baby boy (Quincy Joel) was born January 2nd at 8:20pm.  He didn't seem interested in arriving naturally, so after 20 hours of labor a c-section was performed.  He weighed in at 7lbs 6oz and 20".

He's been great, but kept us busy thus the delayed blog entry.  I'll likely blog about him here in the future as interesting stuff happens.  :-)
