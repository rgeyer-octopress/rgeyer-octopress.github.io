He's being all awesome and doing all he can on his own.  I had no idea he would do so well.

I mean I knew he could do it but I had no idea he would just embrace the process so willingly and be so self sufficient.

He is awesome.

I am proud.

I officially have a giant grin on my face so big that even my baby is grinning since that is what you are supposed to do when someone uses the potty correctly.  Yay!
