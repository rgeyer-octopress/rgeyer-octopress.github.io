You may (or may not) have noticed that there has not been much activity here over the past couple months.  There are a number of reasons for that, but I'll spare you the excuses.  I'm here to tell you that things are about to change.
<!--more-->

There are posts about parenthood and child rearing epiphanies from the lovely Marlena (my wife) scheduled for every Wednesday and Friday from now through just about the end of April.

I'm digging back into my drafts and fleshing out previous trains of through, and starting some new cloud computing projects which I'll be excited to share.  I'm also hope to be finding time to work on, and blog about my Cadillac restoration project.

So, if you were anxiously awaiting every new post here, sorry for the mini hiatus.  But we're getting things back in gear and should be producing some interesting new posts on the regular!
