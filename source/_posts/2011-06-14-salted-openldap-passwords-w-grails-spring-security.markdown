Have to use the LdapShaPassword<whateveritsnameis> bean to create and hash it properly.  Correct size hash is ___

OpenLDAP doesn't support SHA-256 or SHA-512 out of the box, so it has to be added.

ApacheDS doesn't support SHA-256 or SHA-512 until 1.5.6..  ldap-server plugin uses 1.5.4

Gotta use something else to create stuff in the directory if you don't have another mechanism.  ldap plugin (gldapo) with the encryption/hashing mentioned above.

If you want to pull authority info from the DAO objects (we did) you have to implement a custom <what 's that context thingy?></what></whateveritsnameis>
