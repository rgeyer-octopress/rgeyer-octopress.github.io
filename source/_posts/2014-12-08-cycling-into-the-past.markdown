It's Sunday morning, I'm setting out at 6:13am (a bit later than I'd planned)
for a ride I've been wanting to do for some time. I'm expected a good climbing
challenge and to "put in some miles", but what I'm about to experience is so
much deeper and emotional. This experience will simultaneously tell the
narrative of my cycling journey, reminded me why I ride, and transport me to
long forgotten moments in my past.

The weather is colder than forecast and I am under dressed, but that just
means I'll have to ride a bit harder to keep my temp up. I ride at a modest
pace to the base of Old San Marcos as the sun slowly rises. Climbing to the 154
is relatively quick, and clinical. I am riding at threshold in an attempt to
set a PR and possibly determine my FTP using my fancy new power meter.

# Take it all in

Once I cross the 154 and onto Painted Cave, I slow down significantly to recover
from my previous hard effort.

Before too long I come across a group of folks who'd clearly made the trip up
this mountain road to enjoy the sunrise over the city. I start to think about
how in many ways we're doing the same thing, but in different ways. I stop
and take a quick photo.

I ride on...

As I approach a turn out which is a couple of twists further down the road, I'm
enveloped in an invisible cloud of a pungent and familiar aroma. Coming around
the next bend a group of young adults comes into view. They're leaning against
their car, flicking their lighters and laughing jovially. I think about how how
they too are connecting with each other and with this place, again in their
own unique way.

I keep riding to the ridge...

# This feels familiar

I reach the ridge, and descend E. Camino Cielo. I'm officially find myself on a
route I've never ridden before.

I cross the 154 onto Stagecoach, and descend until I reach a fork in the road.
Stopping to consult my GPS map, I realize there are signs pointing to Cold
Springs Tavern. It points in the direction I'm headed.

I think to myself "So that's where Cold Springs Tavern is! Have I been here before?"

I continue descending on Stagecoach, and begin to detect the faint scent of an
oak campfire. As it grows stronger, and I begin to anticipate coming upon a
campsite, suddenly the Cold Spring Tavern comes into view. I slow slightly to
take in a deep breath of the aforementioned oak fire smell, and to admire the
distinctly rustic tavern-in-the-woods.

After dwelling for a moment, I release the brake and continue descending, now
with "Alice's Restaurant" mysteriously playing on repeat in my mind.

# Riding into the past

Thought I know I've never traversed this road on my bike, I feel like this place
is very familiar, I start to wonder why. I vaguely remember my father bringing
me into this Los Padres National Forest to show me these places he frequented
as a young adult. Stories of motorcycles, camping, consumption of substances
both pedestrian and illicit. I recall stories of recovering VW based vehicles,
and on road replacement of drivetrains.

Memories of these stories, and the familiarity of my surroundings, causes my
mind to drift, recalling driving in the SF bay area up into La Honda to visit a
friend of my parents. I immediately associate the aroma that was ever present
his cabin like home with the oak fire aroma I'd lingered to enjoy moments
before. I remember his apple trees, the screams from him and my family as I
nearly roll his riding mower on the steep grade of his property.

Suddenly I'm struck by a pang of acute sadness as I remember that this family
friend passed away earlier this year. Then, as quickly as that though arrived,
it retreats and I find myself distracted by a sign pointing out a Historical
Civil Engineering landmark, the Cold Springs Canyon bridge.

I've driven over the bridge probably hundreds of times, never appreciating it's
magnitude. I think how before it existed, everyone would have had to drive
on the road I'm using now, climbing and descending, adding miles to their route.

Suddenly I'm at Paradise road, I realize I've descended 1700ft being consumed
not by the demands of controlling my bike, but by my own thoughts and memories.

I stop at the Paradise store, which is still closed. The place seems eerily
familiar. I now *know* I've been here before, but can't recall when, it's like
a tattered and faded sepia tone photograph your parents show you of your house,
taken before you were born.

I snap a photo on my cell phone, send it to the guys I usually ride with on
Sunday and decide to turn around to get home.

# Back to the future

As I ride back by Cold Springs Tavern I am VERY tempted to stop and share a cup
of coffee with the gentlemen sitting around the fire. But I refrain, anxious to
get back to my family whom I suddenly realize I'm missing.

Back across the 154 and nearly finished climbing out of the valley I encounter
a man just waking up and stepping out of his camper. We exchange greetings and
I start to think about how cycling and this ride in particular has shaped my
thinking and attitude recently. When I'm out here, I'm only worried about
my most basic needs like eating and drinking enough, pacing myself. I don't
worry about work, debt, car repairs, bills, anything else.

While those things come flooding back to my mind when I stop riding, they've
somehow lost some of their urgency.

I'm longing now only to get home, have a cup of coffee, take a hot shower, have
a hot meal, and enjoy the company of my wife and boys.

I start my descent from the ridge back toward the city. As I get closer I
encounter more cars. I find myself concentrating on riding, rather than my inner
monologue, and realizing how lost in thought I actually was.

This ride started out as a combination training and recreational solo adventure,
but quite unexpectedly became a journey into my past, a lesson in appreciating
my present reality, and possibly a glimpse into my future.

When I started riding over a year ago, I did it for the challenge.  I did it
because it afforded me calories I could use eating and drinking things I wanted.
I never expected it to become a way to recharge, to process thoughts and
feelings.

I'm looking forward to my next mystical journey into the Los Padres National
Forest on my two wheeled aluminum and carbon time machine.
