I had been letting my toddler run around in underwear as clothes seemed to be such an huge challenge.  I had so many things going for us so we tried clothes again.  My toddler did fantastic.  

We spent more time outside which meant that he had to trek into the house to use the potty.  We were putting stickers on the chart, eating our candy treats, high fiving, doing dances.  Life is good.  

I'm now realizing that one day we will have to go out as a family, with my little boy in underwear.  It has to happen.  It will happen.  I am afraid.  This process has gotten smoother but we are about to add a new challenge.
