So here we are.  I used www.blogger.com for a while to host my blog, and it treated me fairly well, but I found it lacked features and customization that I'd started to expect from my blogging solution.

I'm still getting the hang of Wordpress, and I suspect things will be changing around here fairly rapidly, probably first getting a more attractive, non standard theme going.

While you're here, feel free to read some of my old posts, as they've been ported over from blogger.com.  Also, please take a moment to subscribe to my newsletter to receive notifications about updates to the blog, and other interesting bits.
