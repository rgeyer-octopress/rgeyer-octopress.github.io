I remember being young and fighting every single nap time in preschool, daycare, and kindergarten.  I remember whimpering when my parents held true to my 8:30pm bedtime.  I just wanted to stay up and play with the adults, I didn't get why I had to go to bed.  I imagined that my parents were having candy and ice cream parties.  I could hear soft jazz playing in the living room and muffled conversations that had a healthy sprinkling of laughter, singing and silly noises.  I felt like I was missing out on so much.  It wasn't until Jr. High that I started to stay up late for school work and honestly I thought I was a grown up for not complaining.  Then high school I stayed up for cram sessions, reports, homework and started to get that sleep was a valuable commodity.  Still I would stay up Friday and Saturday in attempts to spend time with my mom and grandmother or with my friends.  I had a strict curfew, one that my mom would tell my friends and their parents so that they knew she meant business.

One year I had insomnia, probably had something to do with the 3-5 cups of coffee that I was drinking every day in my sophomore year of high school.   I remember accidentally waking up my mom vacuuming at 1am.  She let me know that I was only allowed to do dishes, wipe down counters and dust if I insisted on staying up that late doing chores.  Clearly my mom was no fool, never tell a teenager to stop cleaning.

I went into a culinary program at the local city college and was in school 40 hours a week.  I got in the habit of waking up early daily (classes started at 6:30am).  I would go home and study, and have catering events at school regularly.  I was a teenager so I would also attempt to have a social life on the weekends minus the class work and catering events.  I finished the culinary program and was a baker at a buji organic grocery store so again I was keeping early hours.  I would still try to go out with friends at night even though I was up  4am to work.  I was a HUGE fan of the power nap.

I changed careers shortly after getting married and was getting used to 8-5 work day but still known to wake up at 3:30am often due to my previous career.  I had health issues and all I did was sleep for 6-8 hours a couple years, which for me is decadent.  

Now I'm a mom, with a newborn (how long do you get to claim that?) and a toddler which means that I'm up by 7am every day and juggling everyone's needs and wants.  I look forward to my toddler's bed time on the crazy days when both boys seem to have arranged their meltdowns so I can have a stereo experience.  Then I get to play the power nap game through the night.  I miss naps, I miss long stretches of sleep.  Hell I miss sleep in general.  

Dear Sleep,
I miss you love and know one day we will be reunited.  I'm guessing it will be about two years but when we are together again it will be fireworks and a crescendo of beautiful music.

Love,
me
