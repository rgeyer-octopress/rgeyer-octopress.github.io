I am a woman from modest means, I have been for as long as I can remember and it has never bothered me.  My parents were young and never given a hand out of any sort when they decided to marry immediately after high school and start a family.  They weren't shunned but money wasn't handed out.  

My life has been modest and I don't think I understood how poor I was as a child until I went through a culinary program at a local city college.  I went in eager to learn, excited to work with all the fancy equipment that I saw on tv.  I went home after the first week completed, eyes wide open and told my mom, "We're poor.". 

It was amazing how real this words became to me, it wasn't like I was never around those that had more than we did, but I never really cared, I simply figured that was just a different way we were all different.

People didn't include me in conversations because I didn't get working hard like them, or at least they didn't think so.  Because I was mostly raised in the beautiful town referred to as the 'American Rivera' and wasn't paying exorbadent amounts to rent a closet, and wasn't working while in college; some were convinced I had to come from a great means.  It wasn't until much later that people talked to me and realized quite the opposite.  They found that I was down to earth, friendly, and humble.  I still laugh about the time people thought I was a rich girl.  Though that rep followed me into the work force as the men I worked with in the kitchen teased me as I only had one job while many of them had two, three and one had four jobs.  That rep I accepted because I was a bi
