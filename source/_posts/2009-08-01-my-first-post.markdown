I guess it is only right to introduce myself.  I am a twenty something year old woman that has been happily married for seven years.  We have been blessed with remarkable baby boy.  I am a multicultural person that enjoys and embraces all that I am made up of.  I have had many an up hill battle and I believe it has aided in who I am and so far I love who that is.
I believe my entries on this will be a bit different than by incredible husband's as I am not an engineer, so only a little will be about photography, cars, and I have little to nothing to talk about computers.  Oh and because I am a girl.  LOL!   So to those that may be just discovering my rantings enjoy the ride.
