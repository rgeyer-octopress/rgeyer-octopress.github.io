You might have noticed a little change to the look of the site.  Until the 23rd of February it'll continue to look this way.  You can see some detail in the right column, and in the following paragraphs.  :-)

There is a little piece of legislation that's been passed in New Zealand which could set precedence for similar laws elsewhere.  In short, this legislation says that any copyright holder can accuse an internet user of copyright infringement or theft, and their ISP is compelled to disconnect them without any burden of proof.

You can read more about it <a href="http://lynnepope.net/internet-blackout-protest-is-not-about-filesharing">here</a> and <a href="http://creativefreedom.org.nz/blackout.html">here</a>. 

Be sure to sign the <a href="http://creativefreedom.org.nz/whattodo.html#signup">petition</a> and if you do, please comment here, I'd like to know my contribution to the cause.
