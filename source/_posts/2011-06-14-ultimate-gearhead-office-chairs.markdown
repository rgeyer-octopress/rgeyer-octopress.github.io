Have you shopped for an office chair lately? Survive the sticker shock?  Do you want to know how I build something much more comfortable, and totally unique using stuff I had lying around?  Read on!

<h2>Lightbulb Moment</h2>

It was official, my $99 Staples Special office chair had finally given up.  There were cat scratches in the pleather, both arm rests were loose and about to fall off, but the death blow was when the hydraulic cylinder finally surrendered and I sat with my keyboard tray in my chest.

I knew it was time to upgrade, but I just couldn't swallow the price of a "decent" office chair.  That's when it came to me, I'll build my own office chairs using the BMW Z3 seats I had "laying around" from another project which never saw the light of day!

<h2>Seat Base</h2>
The first thing I needed was to find a proper foundation for my new office chairs.  As we already established, the hydraulic adjustment cylinder on my existing office chair had totally given up, so I couldn't consider it as a donor.  Besides, I had two BMW seats which I wanted to convert into office chairs.

I resorted first to craigslist to find some neglected office chair which was being sold for next to nothing.  While I did encounter many of these, the problem was that I really wanted two matching chairs at the end of the day, and no one was selling their retired office chairs in pairs.

Then, thinking perhaps I could buy them new from a retailer that has replacement parts for office chairs.  There was certainly no shortage of offerings when pursuing this avenue, but the parts were prohibitively expensive.

The next stop was eBay, seller of all things man made, and usually my first choice for things like this, I should have just stuck to my routine.  Interestingly, I found mostly new parts with very similar prices to the online retailers.  However after a couple weeks of searching and generally obsessing over the "perfect" base for my future office chairs, I finally settled on the classic Herman Miller seat bases you see here.

<h2>Minor Repairs</h2>
You may have noticed from the first photo that one of the seats was... Ohh, let's say "misshapen".  See, I bought these seats from a dismantler and the vehicle had obviously been in a wreck.

The headrest portion of the drivers seat was bent forward and downward pretty significantly.  I started having imaginary visions of what the car must have looked like, and wondered how the driver must have fared!

After shaking it off, I fixed the bent portion of the seat frame by removing all of the upholstery and padding then persuading the tubing a bit with some 2x4's, some jumping, and some hammering.

When all was said and done, I got the drivers seat looking more-or-less like the passenger seat.  Good enough for office chairs, but that seat will never see service in another car.

<h2>Measure once, cut twice, then throw the whole thing away</h2>
The next step was to attach the seat to the base.  Having read a few DIY articles about folks who've built similar chairs, I planned to build a steel bracket which would bolt to the chair, and to the base.

Given that these seats came from a sports car, and didn't sit very tall from their mounting point, I assumed I would have no problem with the seat being too tall.  I was wrong.

Even though my fabricated bracket only added 1/2 inch to the overall height of the completed office chair, the whole assembly was still about 5 inches too tall, even for my 6'4" frame.

The solution to remove the power seat bracketry, as well as throwing away the lovely frame I slaved over, and attaching the seat base directly to the sheetmetal shell of the seat.  You can see the difference between the two approaches in the images below.

Even after making these changes though, the seat was still a smidge too tall to sit in comfortably.  The solution was to cut about two inches off of the main tube of the seat base.  After that final tweak, the seats were all done, and I had a nice comfortable new place to sit.
