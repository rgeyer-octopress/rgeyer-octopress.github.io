My beloved and I just celebrated out nine year anniversary last month.  I still can't believe that I have been married to my husband for nine years.  I can't believe that we have been in a relationship with each other for ten years.  Where does the time go?

When we met I was only 19, just finished college, just got my driver's license.  My husband was only 20 and dreamy as ever.  Within a couple weeks we were planning our wedding.  Yes, we were one of those sappy couples and shortly after realizing that we really like each other we asked a lot of tough questions like if each one of us wanted kids, how many kids, how to handle money, ect.  When we realized that we were compatible in principles and in what we wanted in life for the long haul, we dreamed and planned.  Then a year later, we were married, blissfully.

Now, nine years after saying I do, we have two wonderful little boys and I do believe that my mister got even more dreamy.  I am thankful for the life we have together, just the four of us and hope for many more years with my beautiful little family.
