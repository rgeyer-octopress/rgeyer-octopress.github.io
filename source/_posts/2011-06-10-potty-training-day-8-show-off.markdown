We had a great day and when it came to today's outing, we stretched it out over two hours and the first thing our potty training star did was map out the potty available and tried it out.

Yeah, he is awesome.

He didn't have a single accident and was even applauding himself by the time we got home.  He is a bit of show off. :-)  I'm so proud of my big boy.
