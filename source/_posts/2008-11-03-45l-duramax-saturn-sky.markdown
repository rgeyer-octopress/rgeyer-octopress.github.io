Since the first time I saw the Saturn Sky Roadster I fell in love with it.  Though, with my particular passion for diesel I'd love to see one with a diesel motor.

Well, in 2010 GM is planning to release a <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2007/06/15/gm-announces-clean-diesel-v8-for-pickups-and-the-hummer-h2/">4.5L V8 Duramax.</a>  All of the marketing materials and announcements say that it's being designed to fit into the space of an LS small block, so pretty much anywhere a current GM v8 fits, this thing will too.  And it's currently being estimated at ~345hp!

This is good news, cause there are already several folks who have swapped LS1s and LS7s into Sky's and Solstices, and even some people making <a href="http://www.mallettcars.com/sky-conversion.htm">aftermarket kits</a>.

Now no one has said anything about if the 4.5 Duramax will have the same bolt pattern for the bellhousing as an LS, but it's probably a safe bet that it will.

A sky equipped this way should be able to out perform all but the most elite Corvette, and knock down 35+ MPG on the highway.  Yum!
