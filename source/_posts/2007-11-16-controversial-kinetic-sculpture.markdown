It's been entirely too long since I've made a blog entry, and I've got a lot of stuff lined up when I finally get a few free minutes.<br /><br />In the meantime, this was sent to me, and I found it very interesting, if only from a technical and art perspective.  There is a lot of controversy over the inventor/artists use of the analogy of "life" and "evolution".  I'm not willing to throw my hat into that circle, and I'm looking at this as a purely academic and scientific pursuit.  You're welcome to feel differently.<br /><br />I submit for your consideration "<a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/162">The art of creating creatures</a>".
