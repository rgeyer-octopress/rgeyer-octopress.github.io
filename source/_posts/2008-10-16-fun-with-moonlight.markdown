<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rgeyer/2943100497/" title="dsc_0049.jpg by qwikrex, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3059/2943100497_099d85aa92.jpg" width="500" height="334" alt="dsc_0049.jpg" /></a>

The other night, I couldn't resist the urge to capture this image.  The moon was shining brightly through our bathroom window casting the shadow of the tree and fence(s) behind our apartment.

This was the photo I liked the most, but you can see all the shots I took over at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rgeyer/sets/72157608047756459/">Flickr</a>
