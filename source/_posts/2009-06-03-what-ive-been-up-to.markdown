First, I'm amazed that I didn't mention this here yet!  The picture above is of my previous daily driver, a 1999 Ford Explorer.  On April 7th my wife was driving it home after a light rain, and while accellerating onto an onramp she lost control, spun around 180 degrees and rolled it one time.

Fortunately, she was mostly unharmed.  A few bruises, some cuts, and a few pounds of glass in her hair (only a slight exaggeration) was all she suffered.

I got our insurance company on the case the very next day, and they paid out in about 2.5 weeks from the initial claim.  "In good hands" indeed!  I paid the salvage fee so I could keep the wreck and part it out.

So, what I've been busy with is dismantling this, working on a few computer jobs, and shopping for the X's successor.  And, I've found it...

<p style="text-align: left;">It's a 1967 Cadillac Sedan Deville.  My wife, our son, and I all jumped into the van and drove down to LA this past weekend, and took a look at her.  I picked this car up for a cool $1000, and promptly scheduled an auto transport company to tote it from Fontana to our door step in Santa Barbara.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As we speak it should be getting loaded onto the auto transport rig, and I should have it here by tomorrow.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Stay tuned as I have LOTS in store for this car since it'll be my new project, and daily driver!</p>
