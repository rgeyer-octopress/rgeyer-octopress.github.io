Whether you are a small development company with a tight budget, or an established enterprise with some trepidation about wading into the murky waters of cloud computing, RightScale just made it easier to empowering your development and test teams with cloud computing.

In late September RightScale announced a Development and Test solution pack.  This solution pack is a suite of tools, best practices, and professional services that helps deliver the agility promised by the cloud to your development and test phases.

<a href="http://www.cmcrossroads.com/">CM Crossroads</a> interviewed RightScale's CEO Michael Crandell about the new offering and has recently made the interview available.

If you want to know more after watching the interview, checkout the RightScale <a href="http://www.rightscale.com/products/plans-pricing/dev-test-solution-pack.php">Dev and Test Solution Pack</a> landing page for more info.
