<p>Man, nearly two months without a post here.  Google Analytics tells me I'm only disappointing about two dozen people, so to you my loyal readers, accept my humblest apologies.  But, I do have an excuse or two!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rgeyer/4056790007/" title="Marathon Conference Calls by qwikrex, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3021/4056790007_3a2ae48a63_m.jpg" width="240" height="225" alt="Marathon Conference Calls" class="alignleft" /></a>See, I've been working an insane work schedule.  Pretty much 16-18hours a day 6-7 days a week, mostly on phone calls with an offshore team at odd hours.  When I do have a moment or two that I'm not working, you can bet the last thing I want to be doing is sitting in front of a computer typing a blog post.</p>

<p>To add to that, we moved out of our two bedroom townhouse at the beginning of October, and are just getting fully settled into our new place.  I'm TOTALLY excited about the new house.  We've got three bedrooms and one and a half baths, it's single story which is great because Q can roam around as he pleases.  It's also got a great, and quite large sun room that opens into the backyard, this has become Q's defacto playroom which is excellent.  Plus, we've got a bigger kitchen, a proper dining area where we can sit and eat as a family, and I have my very own office and *drumroll* TWO CAR GARAGE!</p>

<p>Now that we're settled in the new house, and the deadline for work is approaching things are starting to drift back toward "normal" as if there is such a thing for our family.  I even managed to grab a couple hours to work on the Cadillac today, and write this blog entry!  HUZZAH!</p>

<p>In the meantime, my wife has done an excellent job of providing content since I made her an author here to.  You may have noticed <a href="http://www.nslms.com/author/danceof143/">her posts</a>.  I'm totally stoked to have her writing here since I strongly believe she has a future in writing short stories or novels!  I still have two or three of her drafts which I need to review and publish.  And no, I'm not doing a macho "you need me to post for you, you don't have the permissions" thing, she's just not confident enough yet to post without me reviewing/editing.  We'll change that soon enough.  ;-)</p>

<p>Stay tuned to this space for more, as I'll be trying to actually keep things up to date again.  :-)</p>
