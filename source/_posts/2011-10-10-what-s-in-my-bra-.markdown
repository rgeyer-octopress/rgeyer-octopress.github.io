I have breastfed for some 36 months of life between my two kids.  The end result is I find interesting stuff in my bra on the daily.  So far I've found:  Cheerios, gold fish crackers, raisins, almonds, granola, cards, kosher salt (my faultnas i foolishly put a small ramikin of it within my baby's reach),and keys to name a few.  

The apple sticker had me giggling hysterically in the Victoria Secret dressing room as I attempted to shove my boobs into an overly padded bra that was a cup size too small.  The apple sticker, it was a gala, fluttering slowly to the floor out of my bra added a "You are so a mom now" vibe to bra shopping I have yet to experience till that moment.  Oh and the overstuffed sausage look when it comes to sexy underwear is not sexy, even when you are shooting for lots of fabulous cleavage.
