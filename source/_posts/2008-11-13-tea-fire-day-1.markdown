Just became aware of the Tea Fire after driving home.

We're actually further away from this fire than we were from the Gap Fire, but this one "feels" closer because it's much more clearly visible from our home.  The above image is from just outside our back door of our apartment.

So far the air quality is quite bearable, though we're having to keep the doors and windows closed to keep my wife's asthma from flaring up.

You can see all my pictures, right from behind our apartment on my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rgeyer/sets/72157609035026410/">Flickr stream</a>
