The Twitter API Shortcodes (TAS for short) plugin for Wordpress was born from my own need to put single tweets into a blog post with a minimum amount of pain and discovering that there was no existing plugin that covered this need.  I also learned the hard way that all of the Wordpress plugins which will display a twitter search stream depend upon the ever shrinking twitter search index, and there was no way to "archive" tweets for a particular search and keep them in your posts and pages.

TAS allows you to use the super powerful (and convenient) Wordpress shortcode system to print single tweets or twitter searches any where you want on your Wordpress powered site!
