<p>Things have been busy, and I haven&#8217;t had the time to devote to writing updates on either the Caddy, or my work in Grails.  But enough complaining, to pass the time until I can get some more quality content here, I wanted to share this little gem that took me entirely too long to figure out.</p>




<p>I wanted to be able to deploy my grails applications to a sub context, or sub directory of the root of my site.  This way I could leave my blog at the root of my domain, and categorize my grails apps a bit.  Take the following example.  Suppose I wanted to deploy a bunch of example grails apps in a subdirectory named &#8220;examples&#8221; off of the root of my web host.  Something like http://&lt;yourserver&gt;/examples/&lt;your-app-name&gt;.  This is how I was able to finally accomplish it.</p>




<h2>Deploy to a Tomcat Sub-Context</h2>


<p>If you&#8217;re a Tomcat guru this is all going to seem elementary, and it is, but it was superbly difficult for me to mine the information I needed from the web, so I&#8217;m sharing what I&#8217;ve learned here.  If, on the other hand, you&#8217;re a Tomcat newbie like me, you hopefully have a running instance of the Tomcat service.  If you don&#8217;t there are a number of great tutorials, including the official <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/appdev/installation.html">installation guide</a>.</p>




<p>Most of the stuff that you&#8217;ll read out there says that to deploy your grails app, you just upload your *.war file to the Tomcat &#8220;webapps&#8221; directory and you&#8217;re in business.  This is true, but of course when you do this, you just end up with a URL that looks like http://&lt;yourserver&gt;:8080/&lt;your-app-name&gt;.  Now, this is fine if you only intend to deploy a few apps and you dont mind that application being at the root for your domain/server name.  But we&#8217;re trying to put our apps in a sub directory of our site, off of the root.</p>




<p>My first instinct to accomplish this was to use some of the properties of the grails app itself, and I found many examples which recommended this.  So, I happily set my app.context in application.properties to the path I wanted.</p>




<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>application.properties (snippet) </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='groovy'><span class='line'> <span class="n">app</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">context</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">/examples/</span><span class="n">MyExampleApp</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>This works great when I do a grails run-app, I get the app deployed to http://localhost:8080/examples/MyExampleApp just like I wanted.  But, when I create a war and toss it in my Tomcat webapps directory, I still get the same old behavior of the application being deployed to the root of Tomcat with the same name as the war file.  So how the heck do I deploy my war into a sub directory of my Tomcat site?!</p>




<p>The secret lies in not simply dumping your war file into an existing &#8220;context&#8221; for Tomcat, but instead creating your own, and pointing that context to your war file. The first step toward this is to prepare a place for our webapp directories, outside of the Tomcat root webapp directory.  I choose /srv/tomcat-webapps but you&#8217;re obviously welcome to put this anywhere you like.  So let&#8217;s create the directory where we&#8217;re going to deploy our first example app.</p>




<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>mkdir -p /srv/tomcat-webapps/examples/MyExampleApp</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>Now, we need to find the Catalina configuration directory for our Tomcat deployment.  On Ubuntu, which is the environment I&#8217;m using, this is at /etc/tomcat6/Catalina/localhost.  What you&#8217;ll find there, are a number of XML files each one describes a &#8220;context&#8221;.  You can define sub-contexts by using a special syntax in the filename which is just barely mentioned in passing in the <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/config/context.html#Introduction">Tomcat docs</a>.  You can set a multi level context name by using the # character.  So lets create a new sub-context for our example app at the correct path.</p>




<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>#!/bin/sh mark:2 </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nb">cd</span> /etc/tomcat6/Catalina/localhost
</span><span class='line'>vim examples#MyExampleApp.xml
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>Now we need to add the content to this context file which will tell Tomcat where to find the applications files. Remember back when we created a new directory for our tomcat webapps, this is where we&#8217;ll use it.</p>




<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>examples#MyExampleApp.xml </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='xml'><span class='line'><span class="cp">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;context</span> <span class="na">antiresourcelocking=</span><span class="s">&quot;false&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="na">docbase=</span><span class="s">&quot;/srv/tomcat-webapps/examples/MyExampleApp&quot;</span> <span class="na">path=</span><span class="s">&quot;/examples/MyExampleApp&quot;</span> <span class="na">privileged=</span><span class="s">&quot;true&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>Now if you restart Tomcat, and unzip your war file to /srv/tomcat-webapps/examples/MyExampleApp you should be able to navigate to http://&lt;yourserver&gt;:8080/examples/MyExampleApp and see your application!</p>
