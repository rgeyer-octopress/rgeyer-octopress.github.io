Just became aware of the Tea Fire after driving home.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re actually further away from this fire than we were from the Gap Fire, but this one &ldquo;feels&rdquo; closer because it&rsquo;s much more clearly visible from our home.  The above image is from just outside our back door of our apartment.</p>

<p>So far the air quality is quite bearable, though we&rsquo;re having to keep the doors and windows closed to keep my wife&rsquo;s asthma from flaring up.</p>

<p>You can see all my pictures, right from behind our apartment on my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rgeyer/sets/72157609035026410/">Flickr stream</a></p>
