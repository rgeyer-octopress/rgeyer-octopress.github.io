<p>Not long ago I shared my bash script for <a href="/2008/02/20/image-thumbnail-generating-script/">creating thumbnails</a> and manageable sized &ldquo;big&rdquo; images for an image gallery, or other image store.  Well, today I had to update an existing gallery with a pretty significant number of new images.  It occurred to me that I&rsquo;d like to only convert new images rather than re-converting the whole lot.  Then, I&rsquo;d like to simply upload the new files to my server in some automated way.</p>

<p>So here&rsquo;s the tools to do it.  It assumes you have the same layout for your pictures on your local drive as I do, which is as follows.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong><em>RootDirectoryForGallery</em></strong> &#8211; This contains the full resolution pictures directly from your camera, and the following directories.
<ul>
    <li><strong><em>web</em></strong> &#8211; This is a sub directory of RootDirectoryForGallery which contains the &#8220;big&#8221; web version of your image, and the thumbnails directory described below.
<ul>
    <li><strong><em>thumbnails</em></strong> &#8211; This is a sub directory of web, and contains the thumbnail sized versions of the images.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>The first step, is to copy your new pictures from the digital camera to your <strong><em>RootDirectoryForGallery</em></strong>.  Then, we want to get a list of the files that are new, so we run the following from the <strong><em>RootDirectoryForGallery</em></strong>.</p>

<pre lang="bash">
diff . web/ | grep 'Only in \.: d' | awk '{print $4}' | grep jpg &gt;&gt; 3-6-08_update.diff</pre>


<p>This creates a file in the <strong><em>RootDirectoryForGallery</em></strong> named &ldquo;3-6-08_update.diff&rdquo; which contains a list of only the new pictures, one per line.  Now, we want to use our image thumbnail script to convert only the new images to the &ldquo;big&rdquo; and thumbnail sized images.  I discovered that I needed to make a change to my script in order to do this.  Namely in the for loop I needed to enclose the command used to list files in &ldquo;$()&rdquo;.  The modified script is shown below.  Notice the &ldquo;$($SEARCH)&rdquo; where there was previously just &ldquo;$SEARCH&rdquo;.</p>

<pre lang="bash">
#!/bin/bash

SEARCH=$1
SIZE=$2
DEST=$3

if [ $# -lt 3 ]
then
echo "You must pass three arguments 1) The search string (usually *.jpg) 2) The destination size I.E. 500x374 3) The destination directory"
exit 1
fi

for i in $($SEARCH)
do
        echo "Converting $i"
        convert -resize $SIZE $i -resize $SIZE +profile '*' $DEST$i
done</pre>


<p>So with our edited script we convert the files.</p>

<pre lang="bash">
/opt/imagethumbnail.sh "cat 3-6-08_update.diff" "800x600" "web/"
/opt/imagethumbnail.sh "cat 3-6-08_update.diff" "150Ã—112 "web/_thb_"</pre>


<p>Lastly, we want to upload just the changed files to our server.  We&rsquo;ll use rsync for this.  The paths, server name, and user name have been changed to protect the innocent.  ;&ndash;)</p>

<pre lang="bash">
rsync -e ssh -av /path/to/local/copy/ yourusername@yourserver.com:/path/to/www/server/copy/</pre>


<p>And there you have it, with just a few simple commands you&rsquo;ve created thumbnails of all of your images, and uploaded just the new ones to your server.  Easy!</p>
