<p>So my wife and I have this meal tonight.  It consists of one of those <a href="http://www.bertolli.us/classicdinners.aspx">Bertolli dinners in a bag</a>, a salad and some bread, accompanied by the recommended wine pairing (Chianti).</p>

<p>After completing it, we had some pastries made by <a href="http://entenmanns.gwbakeries.com/">Entenmanns</a>.  And no, we don&rsquo;t usually eat so much easily prepared food, we actually do know how to cook and my wife actually completed culinary school, we were just lazy tonight.</p>

<p>So as we&rsquo;re taking the last bites of our extraordinarily rich and sweet desserts my wife turns to me and says;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know what would really finish this meal?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Coffee?!&rdquo; I say sarcastically since she teased me about not making some to go with dessert only moments ago.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Milk?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Close&rdquo; she says.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; I ask&hellip;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pickle&rdquo;</p>

<p>Let that sink in&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>

<p>Clearly the perfect complement to our dessert will be a big salty and vinegary pickle!  Needless to say I laughed till I cried, then vowed to blog the incident for all to enjoy.</p>

<p>My wife insists that I clarify that she meant that the perfect compliment to the entire meal from start to finish would be a pickle.  I still find the combination hilarious.</p>
