<p>Since acquiring my Nikon D80 Digital SLR, I&rsquo;ve been spending more and more time reading and researching about how to best exploit it&rsquo;s capabilities and improve my shooting skills.  As a result of this effort I&rsquo;ve found a wonderful resource on lighting with small off camera flashes over at <a href="http://strobist.blogspot.com/">Strobist</a>.  I stumbled across them when I was searching for a cheap way to build my own &ldquo;light box&rdquo; for shooting small(ish) objects with great studio lighting.  That&rsquo;s how I found <a href="http://strobist.blogspot.com/2006/07/how-to-diy-10-macro-photo-studio.html">this article on creating a $10 macro photo studio</a>.</p>

<p>Even as cheap as it was, I wasn&rsquo;t sufficiently motivated to get the parts together to build it as it would require a couple trips to crafts stores etc.  Then it occurred to me, I already have most, if not all of the materials to build this just sitting around the apartment!</p>

<p>My base was a cardboard box originally used to carry two 2.5 gallon Arrowhead water bottles, it&rsquo;s almost EXACTLY a 12&#8221; cube.  Then, lacking tissue paper, I needed some sort of diffuser.  I then realized I have plenty of white kitchen trash bags which are sufficiently translucent.  After hacking up the box, and putting in the plastic windows all I needed was a backdrop.  An old poster that had been rolled up and forgotten about in a closet for years was a perfect candidate after some cutting.  So here, in all it&rsquo;s glory is my free light box!</p>

<p>The poster I used for a backdrop was a teensy bit wrinkled, and was a bit more reflective than I&rsquo;d like but it&rsquo;ll do for free!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d actually like to build something similar to this, but a bit (maybe a lot) larger to accommodate bigger items and allow more flexibility as far as the angle of the shot.  Right now I feel like I&rsquo;m pretty much required to have the camera pointing straight into the box and I can&rsquo;t shoot anything that fills more than 1/3 or so of the box.</p>

<p>You can take a look at a few of the shots I took with it over <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/30398978@N04/sets/72157607215115568/">here</a>.</p>
