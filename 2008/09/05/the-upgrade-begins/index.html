<p>I just placed the first of two orders for the components to my new desktop machine!</p>

<p>This upgrade is sorely overdue, the last time I got a &ldquo;new&rdquo; machine was about 3 years ago and it was antiquated then.  So I&rsquo;m going from my 2.4GHZ P4 with 1GB RAM and an assortment of various drives to this new beast I&rsquo;m building.</p>

<p>This first order was for a 24&#8221; Widescreen LCD, Ergo keyboard, speakers, and a gigabit switch.  I also ordered a power supply and some fans for an different project entirely.  The total cost shipped was $631.53 with about $50 representing stuff not associated with this upgrade.</p>

<p>The rest of the parts will consist of a 2.4GHZ Intel Core Quad Processor, 8GB RAM, a 500GB drive, Vista Ultimate 64, and a fairly run of the mill 512MB Nvidia GeForce 9500 GT.</p>

<p>Sadly, still not &ldquo;bleeding edge&rdquo; but certainly a big step up from what I&rsquo;ve got.  I&rsquo;m hoping to enjoy it&rsquo;s speed when doing stuff like non linear video editing of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDV">HDV</a> from my camcorder using <a href="http://cinelerra.org/">Cinelerra</a>.  I&rsquo;m sure I won&rsquo;t be disappointed, and I&rsquo;ll be sure to post results here, so stay tuned for more!</p>
