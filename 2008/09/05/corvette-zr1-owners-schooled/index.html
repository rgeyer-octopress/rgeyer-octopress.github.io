<p>Okay, so I&rsquo;ve been a little bit out of the loop on the new Corvette ZR1 in spite of being a Motor Trend subscriber.</p>

<p>Bottom line, this is the fastest car the General has ever produced in any quantity for public consumption.  You can read all about Motor Trend&rsquo;s first drive <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/coupes/112_0810_2009_chevrolet_corvette_zr1_first_drive/index.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>However, my very favorite part is in the first paragraph of <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/coupes/112_0810_2009_chevrolet_corvette_zr1_first_drive/brakes_and_tires.html">this</a> page, where they reveal that every new ZR1 owner will be given the opportunity to attend a free high performance driving school!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s good to see Chevy taking a proactive approach to educating their customers, particularly when planting them behind the wheel of something as quick as the ZR1.  It&rsquo;s not exactly what I proposed <a href="/2008/03/11/check-out-my-new-ride/">here</a>, namely that I should be able to buy a car like the ZR1 if I was able to demonstrate my ability to handle it and my overall enthusiasm for the car, but it&rsquo;s certainly a step in the right direction.  Hey Chevy, how &lsquo;bout if I finish a course with Bob Bondurant &ldquo;with honors&rdquo; you offer me a discounted ZR1?  Yeah&hellip;  Right..</p>
