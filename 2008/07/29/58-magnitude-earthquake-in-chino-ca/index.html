<p>Just felt <a href="http://quake.wr.usgs.gov/recenteqs/Quakes/ci14383980.html">this</a> earthquake here in Santa Barbara.</p>

<p>It was surprisingly long, and USGS is reporting that there were several aftershocks within a few minutes, all right around a 3 magnitude.</p>

<p>Certainly no damage or injuries here (that have been reported), and I just got word from someone in the &ldquo;City of Industry&rdquo; in LA who says everything is fine there as well.</p>

<p>Woo!</p>
