<p>Well, we visited the apartment yesterday afternoon, and found that the wind had reversed and the fire line had moved back nearly to the peak of the foothills behind our neighborhood.  Consequently, the smoke and ash too had receded and were being blow in the opposite direction.  In fact, it looked almost like a normal sunny afternoon!</p>

<p>Since we had packed a few things, and had laundry to do we went back to my mother-in-laws place, and wound up spending the night again.  However we&rsquo;re likely to be back in our apartment this afternoon/evening.</p>

<p>The fire is still just over 8,000 acres and is 24% contained.  Still a reasonable danger of it threatening Goleta, but at the moment it&rsquo;s a much bigger threat to the rural neighborhoods in the foothills.</p>

<p>So far so good!</p>
