<p>I tend to have lots of ideas about project cars that I think are pretty cool.  The chances are I won&rsquo;t ever build any of them, but I figured I could start documenting them here just for fun, or on the odd chance that somebody reads my ideas and decides to build one of them.</p>

<p>So, for my first submission..</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been interested in the early to mid 70&rsquo;s datsun z for some time.  I even bought the &ldquo;jags-that-run&rdquo; book on converting one to a chevy 350 drivetrain.  I&rsquo;m still very interested owning one of these cars and doing an engine swap.  Here&rsquo;s what I think would be cool.</p>

<p>Take a 3.0L diesel, the modern common rail motor that is also dubbed &ldquo;Blutec&rdquo; when all of the emissions magic is done on it, out of a wrecked Mercedes and stuff it into a 240z.  Yeah, there are bigger badder diesel motors but they are heavier and would extend past the front axle of the z.  I&rsquo;m looking for a small, fast, but most importantly agile car.</p>

<p>Of course, the ideal transmission for this would be a true 6 speed manual, but no production vehicle with the 3.0L has one so getting the computer to cooperate, and mating up a manual may be more trouble than it&rsquo;s worth.  However, if you carried over the 7 speed automatic from the Benz and fashioned a paddle type shifter to activate the up and down shifts (should be possible since there is an &ldquo;automanual&rdquo; setting for the Benz that&rsquo;s clearly electronically triggered) it should still be a heck of a lotta fun in the twisties.</p>
