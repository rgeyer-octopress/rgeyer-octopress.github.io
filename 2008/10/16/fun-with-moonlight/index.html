<p>The other night, I couldn&rsquo;t resist the urge to capture this image.  The moon was shining brightly through our bathroom window casting the shadow of the tree and fence(s) behind our apartment.</p>

<p>This was the photo I liked the most, but you can see all the shots I took over at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rgeyer/sets/72157608047756459/">Flickr</a></p>
