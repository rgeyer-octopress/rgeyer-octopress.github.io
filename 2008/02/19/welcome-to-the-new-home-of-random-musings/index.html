<p>So here we are.  I used www.blogger.com for a while to host my blog, and it treated me fairly well, but I found it lacked features and customization that I&rsquo;d started to expect from my blogging solution.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still getting the hang of Wordpress, and I suspect things will be changing around here fairly rapidly, probably first getting a more attractive, non standard theme going.</p>

<p>While you&rsquo;re here, feel free to read some of my old posts, as they&rsquo;ve been ported over from blogger.com.  Also, please take a moment to subscribe to my newsletter to receive notifications about updates to the blog, and other interesting bits.</p>
