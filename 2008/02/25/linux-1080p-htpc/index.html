<p>So, I finally broke down and built a HTPC (home theater personal computer).  Actually, I bought it in late December, and have had it mostly up and running since about the middle of January, but I&rsquo;m just getting the chance to post about it now.</p>

<p>I knew from the start I wanted to run Gentoo Linux with MythTV, and I must say it was an adventure getting it all working.  I&rsquo;ve outlined the details of the build for anyone interested in doing something similar, or who might just be curious.</p>

<h3>The hardware</h3>


<p><a href="http://www.newegg.com/product/product.aspx?Item=N82E16813128072"> GIGABYTE GA-73PVM-S2H</a>
<a href="http://www.newegg.com/product/product.aspx?Item=N82E16822148230"> Seagate Barracuda 7200.10 ST3160815AS 160GB
</a><a href="http://www.newegg.com/product/product.aspx?Item=N82E16819116040"> Intel Celeron 420 Conroe-L 1.6GHz 512KB L2 Cache</a>
<a href="http://www.newegg.com/product/product.aspx?Item=N82E16820134114"> Kingston 1GB 240-Pin DDR2</a>
<a href="http://www.newegg.com/product/product.aspx?Item=N82E16827106070"> Lite-On Black DVDRW</a>
<a href="http://www.newegg.com/product/product.aspx?Item=N82E16880125001"> eDATA DEC-200B Vista Certified Infrared Remote</a></p>

<p>I already had a low profile desktop case sitting around which I used for the project, so that&rsquo;s not included.  Total without the case was just under $300.  I later added two <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16826104027">Logitech ChillStream</a> game controllers for playing console game emulators.</p>

<p>The motherboard was chosen because it had &ldquo;everything&rdquo; I needed onboard and didn&rsquo;t cost a fortune.  I needed HDMI out for my new <a href="http://www.sharpusa.com/products/ModelLanding/0,1058,1922,00.html">Sharp Aquos 42&#8221; HDTV</a> so I could have a clean digital signal at the full 1920x1080 resolution.</p>

<p>The other stuff should be fairly obvious, I had to have a processor, drive, memory, and of course since this is an HTPC, a remote control.  Since I wasn&rsquo;t planning on doing anything particularly processor intensive (see goals) and I was going to be accessing nearly all my media over the network a fire breathing processor and giant hard drive weren&rsquo;t necessary.</p>

<h3>Goals</h3>


<p>I wasn&rsquo;t interested in a TV tuner or using this as a PVR/DVR, nor archiving DVD&rsquo;s.  I wanted this to replace the DVD changer in my existing HTIAB (home theater in a box) and be able to play DVD&rsquo;s upscaled to 1080p.  Also I wanted to be able to play video captured on my <a href="http://www.camcorderinfo.com/content/Sony-HCR-HC1-Review.htm">Sony HDR-HC1 HD camcorder</a> at it&rsquo;s native resolution.</p>

<p>Secondary things would be playing my fairly sizable MP3 music collection, looking at pictures, and other cool stuff you can do with a computer connected to your television.</p>

<h3>Wrestling with the feral Gentoo</h3>


<p>Since I was dealing with &ldquo;bleeding edge&rdquo; hardware at least with the motherboard chipset and the remote control, getting Gentoo linux up and running with support for all of my hardware would be a challenge.</p>

<p>After a fair amount of googling, and plenty of trial and error, I was able to get things working.  For the sake of reference, I&rsquo;ll document the highlights of getting things going.</p>

<p>1) The 2007.0 Live CD wouldn&rsquo;t recognize my SATA DVDR drive unless I booted it with &ldquo;gentoo all-generic-ide&rdquo;, and set the sata controller to &ldquo;IDE&rdquo; in the bios.</p>

<p>2) The latest nvidia driver available in portage (100.14.19) didn&rsquo;t seem to properly support my video hardware, so I downloaded the latest from the nvidia website (169.07) which seemed to work much better.  I actually went so far as to make my own custom ebuild for it.</p>

<p>3) The latest lirc available in portage (0.8.2-r2) didn&rsquo;t seem to properly support my MCE2 USB style remote control.  At the time 0.8.3_pre1 was masked as unstable, but it did the trick</p>

<p>4) Getting the ChillStream&rsquo;s to be recognized by the kernel was interesting too.  A kernel module (xpad) exists that is meant to support these type of controls with the XBOX-360 style.  However, a patch was necessary to properly support these.  It just added the PID to the source to support this controller.  They work great now.  :&ndash;)</p>

<h3>Results</h3>


<p>So, after all that did I reach my goals?</p>

<p>Yes, and then some!  Below is a list of the highlights of functionality, but in all this project was quite a success.  And I think the functionality is impressive considering the bargain price!</p>

<p>One of the things which came as a pleasant surprise was getting MythGame setup with some emulators of old consoles I&rsquo;d played.  It&rsquo;s amazingly nostalgic to play some of those Nintendo games!</p>

<p>What works
* MythFrontend at 1080p over HDMI (should show modelines)
* MythVideo/DVD playing any video I like at native resolution
* xine playing DVD&rsquo;s at 1080p
* MythGallery
* Audio out through TOSLINK optical output, passing along AC3/Dolby Digital &amp; DTS
* MythMusic to play MP3 files from the network
* MCE Remote Control to run MythFrontend
* MythGame</p>

<p>What doesn&rsquo;t
* Audio out through HDMI</p>

<h3>Future plans</h3>


<p>Now that the HD DVD vs Bluray war is apparently <a href="http://www.tacp.toshiba.com/news/newsarticle.asp?newsid=198">over</a> when the drive prices come down a bit more, I intend to put a Blueray drive in this.  I suspect I&rsquo;ll need a more powerful processor to successfully play a movie though.  I&rsquo;m sure that linux will have limited or non existent support for the format for some time to come as well, so we&rsquo;ll see how that plays out.  The hardware is mostly up to the task though, and represents a bargain compared to the several pieces of equipment that would have been required to do the same stuff.</p>
