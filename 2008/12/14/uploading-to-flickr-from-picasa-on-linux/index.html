<p>When I performed my search for the perfect <a href="/2008/09/25/photo-sharing-services/">photo sharing</a> solution, I fell in love with the Picasa desktop application.  I even discovered that there is a linux version.  However, as you&rsquo;d likely expect, it didn&rsquo;t really play nice as far as uploading photos to any photo sharing site other than Google&rsquo;s Picasa Web Albums.</p>

<p>On windows, there is a great solution called <a href="http://jerryong.com/blog/2008/06/picasa2flickr-uploads-your-picasa-photos-directly-to-flickr/">picasa2flickr</a> which passes the desired photo&rsquo;s to the windows <a href="http://www.flickr.com/tools/uploadr/">Flickr Uploader</a>.  Again, for obvious reasons, this doesn&rsquo;t work well on linux.</p>

<p>So, having determined that it wasn&rsquo;t worth my time to pursue trying to get Flickr uploads working from Picasa on Linux, I started evaluating many of the other native options on linux, such as digikam and fspot.  While these more easily uploaded to Flickr, and had open API&rsquo;s, none of them worked quite the way I wanted, so I abandoned my search for a good solution.</p>

<p>Then, on a whim I did a Google search just a couple hours after Andy O&#8217;Neill made a <a href="http://ultrahigh.org/2008/12/09/picflick-picasa-to-flickr-export-on-linux/">blog post</a> about a button he wrote to import photos to Flickr from the Linux version of Picasa, named picflick.</p>

<p>I eagerly (re)installed Picasa3 on my Gentoo box using a beta ebuild found <a href="http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=240406">here</a>.  Then installed his button.</p>

<p>After playing with it for a bit, I realized a few things didn&rsquo;t quite jive for me.</p>

<p>1) The script automatically resizes the image before uploading it to Flickr.  I prefer to upload all of my images at their original resolution, so this was a bit of a road block for me.</p>

<p>2) The script used a Perl module to upload to Flickr.  For the life of me, I couldn&rsquo;t seem to figure out how to get it authorized with my Flickr account to actually permit uploads.  I&rsquo;m sure if I spent a bit more time and read a few more manuals I could have gotten it right, but it didn&rsquo;t quite work &ldquo;out-of-the-box&rdquo; for me.</p>

<p>3) I&rsquo;d prefer to see the progress being made, rather than the beeps and tray notifications that Andy&rsquo;s script provided.</p>

<p>So, I stole the key part of his script, the part which translates Windows paths to *nix ones, and broke down the rest to simply pass the photos on to my preferred linux Flickr uploader, <a href="http://kflickr.sourceforge.net/wikka.php?wakka=Kflickr">KFlickr</a></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the contents of my script, including the win2native function written by Andy.</p>

<pre lang="bash" line="1">
#!/bin/bash

DEBUG=1     # debug to $LOG
LOG=/tmp/picflick.log
PICASA_WINE_DIR="$HOME/.google\/picasa\/3.0\/drive_c"  # Relative to $HOME
PICASA_WINE_DIR_NATIVE=`echo $PICASA_WINE_DIR |sed 's|\\\\||g'`

function debug() {
        if [ $DEBUG -eq 1 ]; then
                echo "$*" >> $LOG
        fi
}

# wine2native(): convert wine filename to native linux filenames
# Arguments: _name_ of variable which holds path
# Example: wine2native file  # not wine2native $file
function wine2native() {
        VAR=$1
        eval "VAL=\$$1"
        debug "Wine path: $VAL"
        # use '|' to delimit the paths
        VAL=`echo "$VAL" | \
                sed "s|C:|$PICASA_WINE_DIR|" | \
                sed 's|\\\\|/|g'`
        debug "Source file: $VAL"
        eval "$VAR=\$VAL"
}

# check we have the required dependencies
which kflickr > /dev/null || die "You need to install kflickr"

file=$1
wine2native file
DIR=`dirname "$file"`
EXT=${file##*.}
debug "START_UPLOAD"
for file in "$@"; do
        wine2native file
        KFLICKR="$KFLICKR $file"
done

debug "Launching kflickr with the following args $KFLICKR"
kflickr $KFLICKR

debug "Done"
</pre>


<p>Now when I click the &ldquo;Flickr&rdquo; button in Picasa, it brings up the KFlickr app with all the pictures I selected ready to upload.  Thanks for the inspiration, and code bits to make this work Andy, I was too lazy to actually figure out what was necessary to pull the image paths from Picasa and use them.</p>
