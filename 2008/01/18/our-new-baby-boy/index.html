Our new baby boy (Quincy Joel) was born January 2nd at 8:20pm.  He didn&rsquo;t seem interested in arriving naturally, so after 20 hours of labor a c-section was performed.  He weighed in at 7lbs 6oz and 20&#8221;.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s been great, but kept us busy thus the delayed blog entry.  I&rsquo;ll likely blog about him here in the future as interesting stuff happens.  :&ndash;)</p>
