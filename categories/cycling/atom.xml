    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s Sunday morning, I&rsquo;m setting out at 6:13am (a bit later than I&rsquo;d planned)
for a ride I&rsquo;ve been wanting to do for some time. I&rsquo;m expected a good climbing
challenge and to &ldquo;put in some miles&rdquo;, but what I&rsquo;m about to experience is so
much deeper and emotional. This experience will simultaneously tell the
narrative of my cycling journey, reminded me why I ride, and transport me to
long forgotten moments in my past.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>The weather is colder than forecast and I am under dressed, but that just
means I&rsquo;ll have to ride a bit harder to keep my temp up. I ride at a modest
pace to the base of Old San Marcos as the sun slowly rises. Climbing to the 154
is relatively quick, and clinical. I am riding at threshold in an attempt to
set a PR and possibly determine my FTP using my fancy new power meter.</p>

<h1>Take it all in</h1>

<p>Once I cross the 154 and onto Painted Cave, I slow down significantly to recover
from my previous hard effort.</p>

<p>Before too long I come across a group of folks who&rsquo;d clearly made the trip up
this mountain road to enjoy the sunrise over the city. I start to think about
how in many ways we&rsquo;re doing the same thing, but in different ways. I stop
and take a quick photo.</p>

</a></p>

<p>I ride on&hellip;</p>

<p>As I approach a turn out which is a couple of twists further down the road, I&rsquo;m
enveloped in an invisible cloud of a pungent and familiar aroma. Coming around
the next bend a group of young adults comes into view. They&rsquo;re leaning against
their car, flicking their lighters and laughing jovially. I think about how how
they too are connecting with each other and with this place, again in their
own unique way.</p>

<p>I keep riding to the ridge&hellip;</p>

<h1>This feels familiar</h1>

<p>I reach the ridge, and descend E. Camino Cielo. I&rsquo;m officially find myself on a
route I&rsquo;ve never ridden before.</p>

<p>I cross the 154 onto Stagecoach, and descend until I reach a fork in the road.
Stopping to consult my GPS map, I realize there are signs pointing to Cold
Springs Tavern. It points in the direction I&rsquo;m headed.</p>

<p>I think to myself &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s where Cold Springs Tavern is! Have I been here before?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I continue descending on Stagecoach, and begin to detect the faint scent of an
oak campfire. As it grows stronger, and I begin to anticipate coming upon a
campsite, suddenly the Cold Spring Tavern comes into view. I slow slightly to
take in a deep breath of the aforementioned oak fire smell, and to admire the
distinctly rustic tavern-in-the-woods.</p>

<p>After dwelling for a moment, I release the brake and continue descending, now
with &ldquo;Alice&rsquo;s Restaurant&rdquo; mysteriously playing on repeat in my mind.</p>

<h1>Riding into the past</h1>

<p>Thought I know I&rsquo;ve never traversed this road on my bike, I feel like this place
is very familiar, I start to wonder why. I vaguely remember my father bringing
me into this Los Padres National Forest to show me these places he frequented
as a young adult. Stories of motorcycles, camping, consumption of substances
both pedestrian and elicit. I recall stories of recovering VW based vehicles,
and on road replacement of drivetrains.</p>

<p>Memories of these stories, and the familiarity of my surroundings, causes my
mind to drift, recalling driving in the SF bay area up into La Honda to visit a
friend of my parents. I immediately associate the aroma that was ever present
his cabin like home with the oak fire aroma I&rsquo;d lingered to enjoy moments
before. I remember his apple trees, the screams from him and my family as I
nearly roll his riding mower on the steep grade of his property.</p>

<p>Suddenly I&rsquo;m struck by a pang of acute sadness as I remember that this family
friend passed away earlier this year. Then, as quickly as that though arrived,
it retreats and I find myself distracted by a sign pointing out a Historical
Civil Engineering landmark, the Cold Springs Canyon bridge.</p>

</a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve driven over the bridge probably hundreds of times, never appreciating it&rsquo;s
magnitude. I think how before it existed, everyone would have had to drive
on the road I&rsquo;m using now, climbing and descending, adding miles to their route.</p>

<p>Suddenly I&rsquo;m at Paradise road, I realize I&rsquo;ve descended 1700ft being consumed
not by the demands of controlling my bike, but by my own thoughts and memories.</p>

<p>I stop at the Paradise store, which is still closed. The place seems eerily
familiar. I now <em>know</em> I&rsquo;ve been here before, but can&rsquo;t recall when, it&rsquo;s like
a tattered and faded sepia tone photograph your parents show you of your house,
taken before you were born.</p>

<p>I snap a photo on my cell phone, send it to the guys I usually ride with on
Sunday and decide to turn around to get home.</p>

<h1>Back to the future</h1>

<p>As I ride back by Cold Springs Tavern I am VERY tempted to stop and share a cup
of coffee with the gentlemen sitting around the fire. But I refrain, anxious to
get back to my family whom I suddenly realize I&rsquo;m missing.</p>

<p>Back across the 154 and nearly finished climbing out of the valley I encounter
a man just waking up and stepping out of his camper. We exchange greetings and
I start to think about how cycling and this ride in particular has shaped my
thinking and attitude recently. When I&rsquo;m out here, I&rsquo;m only worried about
my most basic needs like eating and drinking enough, pacing myself. I don&rsquo;t
worry about work, debt, car repairs, bills, anything else.</p>

<p>While those things come flooding back to my mind when I stop riding, they&rsquo;ve
somehow lost some of their urgency.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m longing now only to get home, have a cup of coffee, take a hot shower, have
a hot meal, and enjoy the company of my wife and boys.</p>

<p>I start my descent from the ridge back toward the city. As I get closer I
encounter more cars. I find myself concentrating on riding, rather than my inner
monologue, and realizing how lost in thought I actually was.</p>

<p>This ride started out as a combination training and recreational solo adventure,
but quite unexpectedly became a journey into my past, a lesson in appreciating
my present reality, and possibly a glimpse into my future.</p>

<p>When I started riding over a year ago, I did it for the challenge.  I did it
because it afforded me calories I could use eating and drinking things I wanted.
I never expected it to become a way to recharge, to process thoughts and
feelings.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to my next mystical journey into the Los Padres National
Forest on my two wheeled aluminum and carbon time machine.</p>
